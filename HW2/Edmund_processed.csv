0,March 2002,entry level performance luxury sedans are a hot area for car manufacturers and enthusiasts alike these sedans show their performance by being fun to drive and handling well they show luxury by offering leather and some of the important creatures comforts found in the most luxurious upscale sedans the selection of vehicles that compete in the space is vast and varied    the benchmarks which define this are the bmw 330 and the audi audi 30 but there are many contenders such as acura tls chryslerm jaguar xtype infiniti i35 mercedes benz cclass volvo volvo t5 some companies have contenders that emphasize performance lexus lexus or luxury lexus lexus and the field is continously growing with the recent additions being the cadillac cts and infiniti pontiac5    the common charateristics of this entry level perfomance luxury group seem to a price around 30 to 40k us dollars and 060 times between six and eight seconds    with this wide variety of cars targeted at a similar market segment the choices for our own personal car are great but with all these choices it is hard to understand and personally evaluate all these options so this topic has been created to start a discussion on the relative merits and personalities of the cars available in this entry level performance luxury field  tagged sedans buying  selling comparisons general,cybersol
1,March 2002,i personally think that with a few tweaks the c320 could also sit at the top of this group its still more of a entrylevel luxury sedan than mercedes benz would lead you to believe the c320 sport needs to have its suspension retuned to accept 17 inch tires without a harsh ride mb also needs to stop forcing metal trim and black leather on everyone that wants the sport package the c240s 6speed wouldnt hurt either if offered on the c320 though it needs to be fixed first    that said my favorite of the group is gasp the new audi 30 the audi easily has the best interior of any sub40k car combine that with stunning looks and a body that is as rigid as any ever made and you have my personal favorite the single thing i dont like about the audi is the grey trim around the bottom of the car this trim doesnt match any of the body colors as it should be body color anyway this is an excellent car and in my opinion the best there is under 40k the upcoming audi convertible coupe and s4 will all be winners    the bmw 330i is now an old favorite but im of all people starting to tire of the 3series just a bit save the bmw variants i was kind of dissappointed by the 2002 facelift they could have done a little more in the way of styling i hope they do a little more for 2003 with the coupe models    the acura tls is easily my favorite fwd car in this class wonderful engine you actually can hear it and decent handling for a front driver nice price seats and what not not hard to see why the tl is so popular this cars main faults are styling and obvious costcutting in the interior stereo fake wood etc otherwise a standout    lexus lexus nice but not my type of car at all this is one for the buick set the lexus is half baked but has a wonderful chassis styling is also in question here it simply doesnt look like a 35k car grown the interior is gawdawful bet on the next lexus being done right from the start in their defense toyota didnt initially intend for this car to be sold in the us so it was a rush job    the cts holds the greatest unrealized potential here ive seen several now and each time i see one they look better and better again like the c320 lexus the car has interior issues the dash feels like it was made by rubbermaid if youre going to be stingy with wood trim why bother half of the steering wheel in wood and very little anywhere else in the car the seats are very good though as is the handling a work in progress    the pontiac5 looks like it may have a winning chassis but the interior though clean looking seems to be styled about 10 years ago lots of square shapes and flat surfaces another great engine waiting to drive this one    dont really care much for the xtype if i were a jaguar man id be truly pissed at ford and jaguar for this one they are actually selling a fwd xtype in england and ive read where theyre thinking about selling it here hell no the car should have been rwd not awd some will tell you that this was done to compete with audi thats bs awd was the only way to keep the car from being fwd without spending the money to convert the car to rwd it is a good looking car though and that jaguar leaper will be enough for some but this car has to grow on me    the chryslerm is about as close to an audi that american cars come this new chrysler special is truly a good looking car inside and out one problem where is the performance a 255hp car in this class with a 060 time over 8 seconds is not accpetable something is not right here some say engine transmission andor gearing but whatever it is chrysler needs to let some mb engineers have a look at this car the heavier e320 with less power is faster i still like this car but its no lust object once you get past the great styling    m,merc1
2,March 2002,i am debating a new purchase and these two are at the top of my list the price difference between these two is approx 6k nontype s acura is the lexus worth 6k over the tl i dont know because i have never owned a tl but i am mazdar with the lexusprevious generation supposedly the 2002 lexus is a lot better than the previous generation but is it that much better than the tl of great importance to me is initial quality and overall dependability does the tl compare with the lexus in both of these categorys i am not mazdar with the honda co are prices lower than lexus for service work i would appreciate any input on this dilemma from some tl owners,fredvh
3,March 2002,great handling rwd excellent engine and the best warranty around easy winner,blueguydotcom
4,March 2002,and no manual tranny that may not matter to you but it most certainly does matter to me and many other enthusiast drivers    so imo its not even on the board let alone the easy winner,hungrywhale
5,March 2002,one beauty of bmw 3 series is that there are so many models to choose from almost half of all buyers in america dont get the basic rwd 4 door sedan besides having 3 engine and 3 transmission choices you can get coupe convertible awd station wagon and superhigh performance mseries    hungrywhale i concur that having the availability of a manual transmission across the line is absolutely critical,riez
6,March 2002,good grief so you wait 9 months for the manual even with an auto i prefer to every car listed and i never have owned an auto and never thought id enjoy driving a car with an auto thats what value performance and an exceptional engine can do for a car once the g has a stick there is not another sedan under the bmw that id consider,blueguydotcom
7,March 2002,ill give it a fair shot when the manual comes out but im just flatout not interested in an auto i dont care how fast it is its not about the speed its about the driving experience and having more control over the car,hungrywhale
8,March 2002,i understand its not about the speed i really dont care if the car wont do over 100 as i rarely break the buick mark what i do care about is power and with the manual mode on the auto i can get it when i want it will i buy an autoequipped g in all likelihood no i desperately want to drive the 6 speed,blueguydotcom
9,March 2002,it sounds like you know why i wont even put it on my list let alone at the top until the manual comes out,hungrywhale
10,March 2002,is there such a thing as an automaticonly true performance sedan not in my book certainly not in europe or asia only in america is such an oxymoron possible sad    if or when the manual pontiac5 comes out and the coupe version then the pontiac5 will be interesting enough to be a serious contender in this segment,riez
11,March 2002,if i had to rank the entry lux performance sedans here is what i would choose    audi audi 30lots of bang for the buck loads of style and loads of luxury    cadillac cts decent btfb good handling nonlemming style    infinity pontiac5tons of bftb good luxury but completely boring exterior and even more boring of an interior    bmw 325very little bftb excellent handlingbuild qualityresale classy looking but too conservative for me    saab viggenalmost zero bftb spotty build quality but the damn coolest style in the world    everything else is not worth my time,wishnhigh1
12,March 2002,hey my friend dig this in australia the only 5series that can be had with a manual gearbox is the bmw yeah right not the 525i 530i bmw or the 540i they are all automatic only     best regards  shipo,shipo
13,March 2002,is there such a thing as an automaticonly true performance sedan not in my book certainly not in europe or asia only in america is such an oxymoron possible sad  if or when the manual pontiac5 comes out and the coupe version then the pontiac5 will be interesting enough to be a serious contender in this segment    riez i read from your profile that you have a manual bmw 5series but i think you are wrong to not consider a car such as a infiniti pontiac5 to be a serious contender as a performance luxury sedan from your logic then the bmw 3series your wifes or the 5series with the steptronic should not be contenders either thats belittling the infiniti audi lexus acuras bmw etc with automatics    when i return in december from qatar i plan on purchasing a sports sedan im leaning on the pontiac5 but the bmw 330i along with the audi s4 are also contenders imo if the handling of the infiniti is as good as the bmw as some that drove it has stated then it will hard to pass up especially for the price also my first choice will be a manual and infiniti should have the manual out by december i will test drive all three manual and automatics and make my choice from there    i do agree with you that manuals are more fun to drive and that will be my first choice but automatics in this category especially those made by bmw infiniti and others should not be eliminated as performance sedans different flavors for different people    i have been following discussions on many boards and what i have been noticing is that there is so many experts on what is the best sports sedan and most havent even driven the competitors to give an honest opinion this is not aimed at you riez or shipko because your profiles states that you own a bmw already but from what i noticed is that some bmw supportors dont even own a bmw at least not from their profile or they state that they never drove an infiniti pontiac5 but they still make unsupported facts assumptions or opinions on such see the edmunds bmw 3series discussion i hope in your defense reiz that you drove the automatic infiniti pontiac5 to give an opinionated statement that it doesnt classify as a performance sedan i value your opinion and others as well    again im not flaming you but i try to be an informed consumer before i buy anything that is the reason that i will drive every car that im interested in and make my choice from there im also always interested in those opinions from people that own the type of car im shopping for and at least drove it so they can give valid pronegative statements    cheers,mbarto
14,March 2002,i think what riez and i are trying to say is not that automatics perform poorly or that only weenies drive them    but any car that truly holds itself out as a performance sedan needs at least the option of a manual tranny manuals are always faster than automatics and they are almost always the choice of the enthusiast driver    theres nothing at all wrong with automatics but i sure dont want one,hungrywhale
15,March 2002,amen,blueguydotcom
16,March 2002,in this class the best bang for the buck has to be lexus assuming one can live with the styling    i guess im one of the few that likes the old audi styling to the new isnt the new audi pushing 3600 lbs now thats pretty heavy for this class,dave330i
17,March 2002,even at 29k for a 35k msrp lexus i passed on it now i never drove a manual one they werent out yet but even with a manual given the cars horrible drivefeel poor interior and lethargic steering i dont think id go near one theyre not up to audibmwmbinfiniti,blueguydotcom
18,March 2002,never liked a lexus and probably never will i would rather drive the cts there is always something that irritates me about them i would buy the is as a toyota but not a lexusi personally think lexus should have a car in its lineup with this cheap of an interior and with this much sporting character toyota deserves something like it though    also i dont think 215 horsepower for 29k is a lot of bang for the buck considering the pontiac5 is the same price with 260 horsies,wishnhigh1
19,March 2002,i would buy the is as a toyota but not a lexus    how else are they going to get that extra 5k from you then    reasonably equipped pontiac5 goes for 33k or so,dave330i
20,March 2002,i couldnt have said it better myself ill let you lead services    mbarto i most certainly will test a pontiac5 manual if and when it finally comes out i promise automatics make nice luxury sedans and maybe even sporty luxury sedans but not performance sedans or luxury performance sedans i dont even consider the 540ia sport truly worthy though it is as close as one can get in an automatic if i could just get my wife to drive a manual,riez
21,March 2002,thanks riez let me know when you do im sure youll get a chance before i will since i wont return until december i am curious of how it compares to the bmw you can speak from experience so ill value your opinion    it does make a difference being married lol see the latest discussions on the infiniti pontiac5 vs bmw 330i board first im fortunate to have a wife that can drive a manual not that she prefers that her first choice is an automatic but she appreciates the hard work and sacrifice im doing out here and knows that this car is for me first family second of course it helps my cause when i let her buy a new dining room set last month and new living room drapes this month bribes do help whatever i finally decide im sure shell be happy,mbarto
22,March 2002,mbarto as regards the bribes issue youve figured out one of lifes great truism you get what you want so i can get what i want,riez
23,April 2002,so if someone were looking to purchase a new performance luxury sedan today what cars would they have to take a look at and test drive lets say they only had time to look at five    what five would they have to look into,cybersol
24,April 2002,since it has to have a manual transmission and should be rwd awd4wd adds too much weight and complexity and has to be fun to drive hard    1 bmw 3 series manual  2 lexus lexus manual  3 cadillac cts manual  4 lincoln ls6 manual    if you want affordable and can go fwd then add nissan nissan 6speed with lsd and maybe nissan 35se 5speed    try to get car with lsd inline 6s are magnificently smooth engines    possible future car infiniti pontiac5 sedan when it finally gets the 6speed manual,riez
25,April 2002,the tl should be up for redesign in a few years so a tl would be outdated in the not so far future and besides it seems like everyone who drives an acura drives the tl i love the lexus some say it looks bloated i dont think it does at the 34 angle it looks impressive the interior is as nice as a car can get if i had the money i would buy an lexus in a heartbeat i never did like the past ones boring stylingespecially since the last two generations were nearly twins go with the es besides lexus quality is ahead of acuras,coolguyky7
26,April 2002,the new es is a very smart looking car notwithstanding any engine issues though i think there are direct price competitors like the i35 that offer better overall value on paper now i havent driven either new model i did drive the older lexus and it did its job very well they are both great cars lexus for legendary reliability and resale value infiniti for uptodate features,kdshapiro
27,April 2002,umyou left off the infiniti pontiac5 and its bland boring brother the i35 the lexuss competition    29k gets someone a 4 door 260 hp performance entry level luxury sedan with all sorts of goodies,blueguydotcom
28,April 2002,sorry i thought that i had already taken up too much space and i also was getting tired of typing when i check out an infiniti pontiac5 maybe ill post something on it    i always thought the i35s looked all right even if they arent the most exciting cars ever built,jagboyxkr
29,April 2002,go drive one theyre a blast and for the money theyre a steal if someone wants entry level performance luxury at a great price the gs really tough to beat    save for bmw it sort of stands head and shoulders over most of its competition,blueguydotcom
30,April 2002,i cant make a decision i was set on the mb c240 but then i read some postings from people who got lemons now i am starting to think that the audi 30 cvt front wheel drive is what i shoud get any advice low manintenance is what i am looking for  thanks,steffie2jc
31,September 2002,the xtypes structure is 30 more rigid than the previous class leader the bmw 3series    i think the xtype still has a way to go as far as i go before i ever would consider one to be a class leader    while you have a private debate going with riez  my two cents you buy what you buy for the reasons you buy but the trades and mags of barometers you have to read them understand where they intersect with your beliefs and opinions and take it from there    in addition a 40k 330i is almost loaded and a base 330i can be had for 32k at ed plus airfare,kdshapiro
32,September 2002,here i built a fullyloaded rwd 330i    base price 33990  645 destination charge    metallic paint 475  leather 1450  wood 500    sport package 1200  weather package 1000  premium package 2900  reverse sensors 350  navigation sys 1800  xenon headlamps 700  auto tranny 1275  allow wheels 900    msrp fully loaded 45235    this was done at the bmw us website its a little higher than that 40k estimate of yours my point is not to single out the 3 for high pricing but to demonstrate that while a nicely equipped one can be had for around 40000 like any other car in its class it carries a high price when totally fully loaded this is my point about the xtype in the 11 car rt comparison a nicely equipped one similarly equipped with that 40000 3 in the test can be had for around 40000 but the editors instead chose to get a totally fully loaded one and then mark it down for a high price it wasnt quite fair totally fully loaded the mercedes benzmercedes benz would have been the most expensive car in the test by quite a margin ever notice how the eclass starts at around 50000 but the stype and 5series start at around 42000    as far as class leaders go i believe that all of the cars in this class are very good and that they target slightly different groups xtype and cclass have more luxury than the others pontiac5 and 3series are a little more performance oriented but all of them share many traits with slight variances in the degrees of those traits    its nice to hear from you we havent talked for a while happy driving,jagboyxtype
33,September 2002,jagboyxtype i merely pointed out how when the american automotive press has had a chance to test the xtype up against its main competitors it falls flat pretty much every single american comparison test    why do i bring up american tests because i cannot buy a eurospec xtype in america and many of the european cars a eurospec xtype is compared against in these tests arent even sold in america besides marques like fiat seat alfa lancia etc heck i cant even spell the french marques that are no longer sold in usa renault and peugueot been so long since since ive even seen an old frenchmarque car in my neighborhood    so ensuring all the cars are usaspec is critical to a legitimate comparison    and ive always loved the probrit bias in the english car magazines they do whatever they can to say nice things about english cars i nissan thru their mags at my local borders and barnes  noble the german press has raved about the underlying ford mondeo platform mondeo built in germany,riez
34,September 2002,ive been subscribing to autoweek for over 10 years and i dont recall that issue if you know what issue that is in due tell i have hard time believe they did a specific testing of each of these cars structures to determine that the audi is the one i felt was the most solid as far as that test goes i think it was basically set up to show up any weakness the c320 may havei dont think a 12 second is stomping anything into the ground and the jag should have been faster considering it was a manual beating the cclass at acceleration and braking is not really that hard since that isnt what the car fordes on primarily id be more impressed with a pumeling by the xtype of the 330i or lexus in those areas    dont get me wrong i dont think the xtype is a bad car but that test had more than a twinge of bs to it    m,merc1
35,September 2002,i dont know what car you speced out but its not my car i dont deem a nav system a must on a fully loaded car i am talking about leather sport and most high end options my 330i does not have sport nav or xenon but if i did it again i might have gotten sport to me its fully loaded because there is nothing else i wanted and i belive the navs are the biggest waste of money anyway if you want to split hairs and say fully loaded is every available option thats your call    people have different requirments for what they want in a car we have to be careful between comparing the msrp of fully optioned cars because most people do not order them that way the base 330i with leatherette can be had at ed for a mere 32000    btwnice to to talk to you as well,kdshapiro
36,September 2002,kshapiro cant believe you did not get sport package that is almost heresy    dont forget that bmw current nav system stinks just now finally moving to dvdbased system instead of cd but still most reviewers prefer systems used by other marques i think a mark 1 eyeball and a good map beats a nav system about 99 percent of time and the dash looks better without one imho,riez
37,September 2002,they were interested in moving the carand i really like that car so i decided to take it well see what the landscape looks like the next time around,kdshapiro
38,September 2002,merc1    go to    httpautoweekcomsearchsearchdisplaymvportcodeautoweekcatcodereviewscontentcode09870788searchtypestdsearchid609952record2    they say this particular partssharing it turns out only gives the jag its chassis hard points and its engine blocks but not much else jaguarites say the chassis itself shares only six small panels with its blueoval counterpart and that their version has been reinforced significantly for stiffness and quiet in fact they boast by the time the leaper hood ornament goes on the car its static rigidity is 30 percent better than that of the nearest luxury segment competitor by another measure body stiffness comes in at 22 kgdegree vs the 21 kgdegree recorded by the bmw 3 series a mighty fine measuring stick to use see they measured itb    other reviews have noted that it has the most rigid structure in its class i can find them and post their urls if youd like if this review is not proof enough    also if the link doesnt work because the site is a signin type go to autoweekcom and use their search box typing in jaguar xtype    btw i do think that xtype v cclass review was also a little bsed however i believe all comparison reviews are either a little biased or include some bs as you can read about in my long posts a few messages away however    you say beating the cclass at acceleration and braking is not really that hard since that isnt what the car fordes on primarily    isnt the cclass supposed to compete with the lexus 330i and xtype why is it that when the xtype does win excuses can be made for the other cars with they dont ford on those areas im willing to invalidate the transmissions in the this test as they were not totally evenly matched there but the xtype won out every other category of the test as well engine brakes ride i could just as easily say that the xtype doesnt ford on those areas either but no one would back me and it really is a poor excuse you also note that 12 second is not stomping anything to the ground yet in the roadtrack 11car test the xtype was just 06 second slower than the fastest car in the test and it was marked down for that we cant suddenly make an exception for this test i could say that the xtype doesnt ford on acceleration in the rt review but again that is a poor excuse if we choose to accept the rt 11 car test then we must by principle accept this test as well in those regards the xtype v cclass comparison was quite valid    take care      riez    i think ill terminate this discourse now that we have both had our say its just going to continue in a perpetual loop if we dont stop but    i noticed that you still say the car falls flat and in all of those comparisons you have said yourself that price was a major factor in the cars losing points as well as rt cd and others noting that im just wondering if you read my really long message a ways back as i outlined how the xtype in all of those tests was outfitted much more heavily with options than any of the other cars and that its price would have been closer to the others had the xtype been outfitted with the same options as the others in the test also as merc1 notes 12 second differences etc are not large gaps being 06 second off from the fastest car in the test and 05 from the winning car is not falling flat by any means    you seem to fail to notice actual measurements and what the reviewers write about the cars and instead only look at points and scores take note of the luggage space scores for the cars in the rt 11 car test for instance the xtype has a boot capacity of 160 cubic feet for that it received 78 out of 10 possible points in that category now look at the cadillac cts with a boot capacity of 128 cubic feet yet it received 84 points out of the 10 and it had a smaller boot the infiniti pontiac5 has 148 cubic feet of boot space yet even with less space than the xtype it received the same score of 78 out of 10 the 330i with only 107 cubic feet of boot space received 76 points only 02 less point than the xtype with 53 more cubic feet than the 330i these ratios arent right and i cannot help but feel that their other points and scores must also be affected by these kinds of discrepancies    i also still disagree with you about european or other comparison tests not being valid included in these tests are cars such as the xtype cclass and audi et al that are sold in the us as well as cars that are not available here just because a car is not usspec doesnt mean the test is totally invalid in those other countries especially those tests are very valid as far as comparison tests go it is not a question of whether or not the test is valid just to you rather it is a matter of how valid the test is as a fair test thats where the problem is you are choosing which tests you want to acknowledge and which you simply feel like leaving out besides the difference between a usspec car and a nonusspec car is not going to come out in the test unless the car is crash tested or has an engine choice unavailable in the us etc you can get a general idea still and to simply say that because it is not a test conducted by an american magazine is a bit ignorant especially as all of these cars are global cars    you also claim that english reviews have a bias towards british cars and that the germans also are biased however i have found that those two groups especially are very picky about cars and will tear a car apart worse than any american reviewer would dare to the british also have a thing for bmw  a german car  and ive not found a review where they had a bias for jaguar or any other british car and if they were biased and i missed it they certainly could not be any more biased than any american editors    perhaps you have not noticed the bias that american reviewers have for german and japanese cars i believe edmunds stated something about their infatuation with everything german in a mercedes benz review and the idea that japanese cars are so much more reliable than any other cars is also overplayed to the point of now being a bias of american writers and dont attempt to say that im saying that japanese cars are not reliable now because they are im simply pointing out that there is an american bias of believing that they are tremendously more reliable than any other kind of car,jagboyxtype
39,September 2002,kdshapiro    you said i dont know what car you speced out but its not my car i dont deem a nav system a must on a fully loaded car i am talking about leather sport and most high end options my 330i does not have sport nav or xenon but if i did it again i might have gotten sport to me its fully loaded because there is nothing else i wanted and i belive the navs are the biggest waste of money anyway if you want to split hairs and say fully loaded is every available option thats your call    thats exactly what i was trying to prove about the xtype in its tests take for instance the roadtrack 11 car comparo the xtype had every option available including the unnecessary navigation system and other equipment that the majority of other cars did not have it has been that way in almost every comparison test the editors choose a fully loaded as in every single available option xtype and then mark the car down for being expensive in comparison to competitors that are not fully loaded    you are totally correct no one ever totally and fully loads out their car with every available option but the reviewers all do for the xtype in its comparison tests they dont for the other cars even that secondmostexpensivecar in the test c320 sport was still not fully loaded it didnt even have a cd player as i mentioned before in my other message in the magazines they depict the xtype as costing 46000 all of the time a base xtype 25 with standard connoly leather wood trim and manual transmission can be had at 29000 make the car a 30 litre model and you get everything in the base model plus standard indash cd player and other goodies and your choice of manual or automatic transmission at no extra cost for 35000 nicely equipped a 25 is usually around 33000 a nicely equipped 30 is around 38000    in my other message i wasnt trying to talk about your car i was using the 3series as an example of how in the tests theyll get a nicely equipped one at 39000  40000 but that the cars fully loaded price is 45000 just as they only showed the xtypes fully loaded price of about 46000 when one that is nicely equipped is between 38000  40000 just like the other cars,jagboyxtype
40,September 2002,okay i missed the point that particular car left nothing out in the options category most people do not buy a car like that,kdshapiro
41,September 2002,jagboyxtype maybe well have something to discourse about when ford improves the future mondeo xtype such that it can actually be competitive against cars in its class as it stands it just doesnt compete well as a serious all around sport sedan sure it has a big trunk but it also has a cdodgeped back seat but i dont buy a serious all around sport sedan based on interior or trunk space and sometimes a big trunk is offset by an odd shape and spaceintruding hinges that limit useability over a smaller trunk that is nicely shaped with multilink hinges oops think i meant to say when jag improves the future xtype     and ill really really start worrying about and paying attention to european magazine results when eurospec cars are sold here but today i can not even buy them think you should keep in mind that they often have many differences with their american counterparts eg safety equipment enginesthey love diesels transmissions and there are tons of marques in europe that are absent in america alfa fiat lancia seat renault peugeout skoda etc,riez
42,September 2002,riez    you missed the target again the trunk space example was simply an example of how the points awarded to certain aspects of the cars in the tests do not tell the whole truth as you misguidedly seem to believe the fact of the matter is that the xtype had more boot space than the other cars i mentioned and it recieved less points than they did and in an unbalanced ratio and that other scoring categories were similarly affected you also failed to notice the phrases for example and for instance leading into what i was saying in many cases if you believe that boot space was all that i was speaking about    you said of the xtypes large boot and sometimes a big trunk is offset by an odd shape and spaceintruding hinges that limit useability over a smaller trunk that is nicely shaped with multilink hinges    from this i can tell that you never actually take the time to examine a car for yourself before passing judgement on it but instead rely completely upon little comparison test articles and your own assumptions as the xtype does have multilink boot hinges as opposed to the swanneck hinges on such cars as the xj8 and lexus ect that you assumed it had and then stated it had as if it were a fact but what can i expect from someone who finds himself clever at falsely mistaking a car for one with which it shares a few parts that cannot even be seen    and on that topic in the global car world of today every car shares parts with another or many others for example if you miss it this time i dont know what to do bmw uses general motorssourced automatic transmissions and parts are shared with mini volkswagen and audi seat skoda porsche bentley lamborghini and bugatti all share many imany parts daimlerchrysler and mercedes benzmercedes benz share some parts now too as well as sharing parts with hyundai and mitsubishi making fun of that seems well kind of pathetic  unless you have a weird sense of humor they share parts yeah  so what its not really relevant    and as i noted about reviews and comparisons from other countries the cars do have some differences from usspec cars as you and i had noted that engines can be different etc but a general idea of the car can be had from those tests  as i had also said before in my other message quite often those tests even use the versions of the cars equipped with engines that are sold with them in the us as we generally have the larger versions of the engines available to us if its a dieselengine test they usually also have the whole test based upon that fact and will call it a diesel showdown or something else to that same effect again for now the second time you cannot simply invalidate a test because it was not conducted in america the cars we are disputing are not even built in america and many times the versions of the cars used in the tests are for the most part equivalent to their usspec versions alpha romvolkswagen fiats renaults and vauxhalls are not sold in america and thus i understand saying that for use in america their tests would be for the most part inconcequential but audis jaguars bmw and mercedes benz are all sold in the us as well as foreign countries and those foreign versions of the cars have little difference from their usspec versions as far as any test categories can gauge they never crashtest the cars in these comparisons and as c van tune pointed out in the abc article about how reviewers are fed and fueled by certain car manufacturers safety isnt an exciting enough category for these tests so to those reviewers who write about them it is irrelevant safety equipment is usually the primary difference between usspec and foreign versions of the same cars but thats not going to showup in one of these car comparisons because they are not comprehensive enough at all to measure such things yet its not just foreign articles that you are saying are invalid though you are just choosing the ones that back your arguement to the slightest degree which again just a display of your ignorance    as well as the boothinge thing that you got wrong remember xtype has the multilink hinges with autoopening gas struts not swanneck hinges you also said that it had a cdodgeped rear seat in comparison to its competators in comparison to a longwheelbase maybach it is cdodgeped yes however it has one of the larger rear seats in its class not only is it larger than the bmw 3series rear seat as well as the lexuss and audis but it is also larger than the midsize 5series rear seat but ill admit not by that much compared to the 5 in posts in other sections of the town hall you defend how large the 5series rear seat is and how comfortable it is for adult passengers as far as roominess goes why do you call the xtypes rear seat  which is even larger than the 5s  cdodgeped is this yet another assumption that you made about the xtype    by now i am sure that you have noticed that i have continually refered to things in this message that i have already spoken about in my other two posts addressed to you a few messages back im wondering if you really even read them since your arguements are always the same and now youre even making outright assumptions no matter what i say and no matter how many facts i back my statements with you seem to have your eyes closed to them and dont even take them into account not only that but your statements are generally incorrect and your assumptions dont even touch on facts or reality    and id say the best selling jaguar in history is competative when it makes up 567 of jaguars us sales and holds an astonishing 66 of the entrylevel to mid luxury segment in europe as well as over 70 of jaguars sales in its third largest market italy was your statement about being competative just another assumption on your part    maybe well actually have a discussion when you start taking note of whats actually going on with the car and stop making assumptions and false remarks good day,jagboyxtype
43,September 2002,ok i read all that so im supposed to believe jaguars claim over what every other brand claims right until i see an independent test of all of the cars in this class structural rigidity ill go by what feels the most solid and it isnt the jaguar xtype so we disagree there  secondly everyone knows full well that the cclass is not on the same plane with the 330i and lexus when it comes to being sporty to impress me youd have to beat those cars at all the track tests beating a c320 at the track isnt hard the lexus and 330i rule there that acceleration test will never count in my book because of the trans difference    im not saying the comparison as a whole was not valid but i still maintain that they picked the areas in which the xtype would winout and lastly the xtype has been ranked below the c in every other comparo done if it were such a slaughter id think it would win some test over here too    m,merc1
44,September 2002,jagboyxtype you should have more carefully read my post did i specifically mention the xtype trunk boot no i was discussing trunks in general and did you notice how i was careful to say that neither trunk space nor rearseat space should have much if any bearing when it comes to comparing serious all around sport sedans do you harp on such little things regarding the xtype becasue it does so poorly in the performance realm when tested against its competitors when you get creamed on the track and street talk about the trunk    i dont care about sales figures what do they prove if we used that wed all be driving a toyota or honda 4cyl sedan    as for euroland market keep in mind two huge facts currently about 40 percent of the cars sold there are diesels the hottest bmw is the 330id can i buy that in usa no and that over 80 percent of the cars sold there are manual transmission how many manual transmission diesel sedans coupes convertibles etc are sold in usa be willing to bet the figure is about zero ford europe and jag are rushing to get diesels into their europroducts,riez
45,September 2002,riez    again my point was that the boot space example was an example of how the points awarded in such comparison tests do not give real data points and scores are skewed  or whatever adjective you would use to describe awarding more space with less points in a category that is all about having more space    and did you notice how i was careful to say that neither trunk space nor rearseat space should have much if any bearing when it comes to comparing serious all around sport sedans    yes i did catch that phrase the first time i read it however your argument against the xtype in you message before the last was that it had a cdodgeped rear seat and had swanneck bootlid hinges  both statements that were false and now your latest statement that you did not name the xtype directly when speaking of such things as bootspace and rearseat room really is a weak coverup    you stated maybe well have something to discourse about when ford improves the future mondeo xtype such that it can actually be competitive against cars in its class as it stands it just doesnt compete well as a serious all around sport sedan sure it has a big trunk but it also has a cdodgeped back seat but i dont buy a serious all around sport sedan based on interior or trunk space and sometimes a big trunk is offset by an odd shape and spaceintruding hinges that limit usability over a smaller trunk that is nicely shaped with multilink hinges oops think i meant to say when jag improves the future xtype    your argument was that you do not consider rearseat room or trunk space when it comes to sportsedans because those are two areas in which the xtype excels if it had a small boot and a cdodgeped back seat then you would be attacking the car for those two points then to further attempt to deride the xtype you state that large boots such as the xtype has often have spaceintruding swanneck hinges and odd opening shapes of course you did not have to name the xtype when making such statements  you implied it and did indeed name the car with the word it why even mention spaceintruding hinges if the xtype does not have them also paragraphically your topic was about the xtype and as those areas were spoken about there they are directly linked to the xtype however your arguments were wrong and to counter my catching of them being wrong you are now stating that you were not speaking of the xtype  a weak argument    i dont care about sales figures what do they prove    you constantly say that the xtype does not compete well against its competators sales figures and how much of the cars manufacturers sales the car makes are a direct indication of how well the car competes if the car did not compete well then it would in turn have low sales figures and most probably not make up much of its manufacturers sales the toyota and honda 4cylinder are not in the entrylevel sport sedan class however in their own class it is generally accepted that they are very good cars also the ratio of new buyers of a new addition to an established market segment is an indication of how well the car competes and over 90 of xtype buyers are new customers to jaguar that means that it is taking sales from competators that compete in that market segment  thus it is competing very well    if you have not gotten the fact that there are european comparison tests of cars that are sold here in slightly different forms but with the same engines as usspec versions then it is just a show of your unwillingness to be reasonable to any degree i have stated that those cars are not exact doubles of their us versions but the ones outfitted with gasoline engines that are available in the us and other such options are so much like their american versions that a comparison test is not going to be able to differentiate the two if there are differences measurable by the tests then you can take them into account however to invalidate the entire test is ignorant and unreasonable    do you harp on such little things regarding the xtype becasue it does so poorly in the performance realm when tested against its competitors    no i harp on such little things because you bring them up by making false assumptions which you present as if they were facts again i used those little subjects as examples to prove my points because facts are a necessity in presenting the truth you are the one who decided to harp on my examples    also as i have stated and continue to have to remind you the xtype does not get beaten in the performance realm against competators examples the xtype completely won an allout performance test against the competing model from mercedes benzmercedes benz the c320 sport it is a competing car then your soveryimportant roadtrack even states in acceleration the 30 xtype is among the quickest accompanied by a nicebutdistance exhaust note the jag goes from 060 mph in 65 seconds undercutting the boyracer lexus is 300s and audi audis 71 mercedes benzmercedes benz c320s 68 sec and matching the bwm 330is time and remember the xtype like the audi loses a tick off the line because of a nowheel spin launch with allwheeldrive hondaing to your precious magazines it also out brakes the porsche 911 gt2 from 80 mph and stops just 2 feet shorter than the 911 gt2 from 60 mph that is real performance and if you try to argue that down i believe i could safely say that it is a sign of a delusional mind    perhaps you should stop simply reading my posts but should actually begin synthesising the data as well im having a hard time responding to much of the outrageously false statements youve made thus far    you did get one thing right though jaguar is getting diesel engines ready for the european market as they do make up for much of a manufacturers sales there that was a weak point for the xtype it had no diesels to compete against the 330d etc with the high gasoline prices in europe rest assured that when the engines are available the xtype will compete even better than it already does so well and when im on the track ill remember to mention my cars boot to the porsche that i outbrake and to the is 300 audi c320 that i out accelerate and the bmw driver that im deadlocked with even roadtrack took note of that,jagboyxtype
46,September 2002,merc1    other marques are not claiming that they have more rigid structures than the xtype has because they do not you say that youll go by what you feel feels more solid however i could just say that the xtype feels more solid to me and say that the discussion is over either way we cannot do that autoweek had the measurements for structure rigidity in their article and i even quoted them a little way back they also noted that the xtypes structure is 30 more rigid than the previous class leaders that means that the previous class leader no longer has the classleading structure in rigidity because the xtype now the class leader in structural rigidity beats it by 30 you are just choosing not to accept a fact    as for the x v c article you say that they chose to test in areas where the xtype would win but then wouldnt other car media groups just be choosing areas in which the 330i wins the same can be said about any comparison look at what is said in these articles pointwise the cclass may win however in actual measurements the xtype beats it take for instance what roadtrack said about acceleration which i quoted above in my message to riez    oh well we dont agree on this one at least you have an open mind enough to at least read the articles etc whether you choose to believe what is said is you choice have a nice day,jagboyxtype
47,September 2002,thirty percent more rigid ummmmmmm    chris,ccotenj
48,September 2002,considering most manufacturers make improvements in rigidity on the scale of 50 to 100 percent when they do a platform update 30 sounds at least a little reasonable lets get pluskin in here he should know and if not he should be able to find out i would trust him more than any hearsay in this forum,wishnhigh1
49,September 2002,betcha cant get a jag bmw or audi with a thong holder ,jlan
50,September 2002,i havent heard from pluskin in awhile    they double their rigidity with every platform update since its you telling me i believe you but that kinda boggles the mind one would think theres a point where you cant go beyond    chris,ccotenj
51,September 2002,omgyou guys actually read through all that,diploid
52,September 2002,how ironic the one car they couldnt have known about yet was the audi it came out after the jag by a few months if the bmw 330i was the class leader dont you think the new audi surpassed it too landing it squarely at the jags level or beyond    as for the x v c article you say that they chose to test in areas where the xtype would win but then wouldnt other car media groups just be choosing areas in which the 330i wins    i agree there weve had this connissantion before car and driver is most guilty of this agreed their last comparo was seemingly decided on how the 330i handled mountain roads something most people dont drive on in my opinion road and track conducts about the fairest comparos    i always willing to read and listen hence our actual debating and not outright arguing    that said its been another fun one    m,merc1
53,September 2002,i know that the audi is 40 more rigid than the previous audi but i dont know what its actual measurements are it being more rigid than the xtype has not been mentioned in any reviews that i have seen as of yet so i cannot say that the car is more rigid than the xs structure in many reviews the editors have stated that the xtypes structure is the class leader in measured rigidity and as many reviews have concluded this i accept the fact if the measurements of the audis rigidity came out and proved to be higher than the xtypes then i would accept that however at this moment the xtype is known as the most rigid car in its class    this is not to say that the audi has not surpassed the 3series in rigidity or possibly the xtype or to say that the car or any of the cars in this class are lacking in structural rigidity it is simply to say that with the information available all current measurements have proven the xtype to be the most rigid to this day    i always willing to read and listen hence our actual debating and not outright arguing    yes thank you for being that way it makes discussion so much more pleasant when two people can actually debate without losing total respect for each other and resorting to primitive argumentative states you always review the information presented and can thus make valid statements as you said its been another fun one keeping open minds makes life so much more enjoyable    btw  have you read about the recall on the pontiac5,jagboyxtype
54,September 2002,well until either of us run across the audis chassis figures i guess neither of us can say anything either way huh im a gambler and im betting the audi is stiffer plus that that was only review of the xtypes structure i dont recall reading that it has the stiffest structure by any publications on this side of the pond other than autoweek    i havent read anything about the pontiac5 i simply dont like the car    m,merc1
55,September 2002,lol yea i was bored    chris,ccotenj
56,September 2002,well in any case we dont know the exact figures for any of the cars in quantitative terms so we cannot make a complete judgement however what i can judge with relative certainty are the crash test results for the x type 3 series c class and various other models which is related to structural stiffness and design from these results    httpwwwhwysafetyorgvehicleratingscehtmlsummarymidluxhtm    and    httpeuroncapcomratingsphp3idlargefamilycarsordesubaru    i am pretty certain that the c class has the best designed structure in its class with the jag being behind the 3 series and the audi the c class was one of only 2 cars in the euroncap test to get a full 5 star rating and the c class is the highest rated midsize luxury car hondaing the insurance institute the intrusion and deformation ratings are as follows    httpwwwhwysafetyorgvehicleratingscehtmlgreymidluxhtm    anyway if i had a choice on any of these cars id save up my money and get an e class but thats my personal opinion,linard
57,September 2002,actually stiffness mainly determines how much a cars twists during quick handling maneuvers  whereas occupant protection arises from engineering to divert kinetic energy from the crash into crumple zones and away from the main passenger cabin the challenge is actually to get the stiff but crushable compromise correct    so stiffness equals good handling more than occupant protection,cybersol
58,September 2002,actually this isnt the xtype we have here in the us    this is the xtype section of the car crash test above      httpeuroncapcomdetailsphp3idcasubaru172002      take note that this is the jaguar xtype 20 lhd marked under the make model and hand of drive portion of the chart at the bottom of the page the xtype 20 is the lowend europeonly version of the car that lacks the extra driveshaft that the 25 and 30 litre models have that are sold globally as well as the driveshaft that is found in the 3series and cclass thus its crash tests produce weaker results than the 25 and 30 versions and 3series and cclass because 20 is a fwd car with no longitudal driveshaft that is found in awd xtype and rwd cclass 3series cars      check out this site      httpwwwhwysafetyorgvehicleratingscehtml0210htm      it notes that the xtype underwent structural changes after december 2001 but does not say if that was a versionspecific change which i discovered it was a letter to consumer reports aided research and their reply was as follows      we spoke with jna jaguar north america on this question and they explained that the jaguar xtype was originally introduced in europe as a 20 litre fwd front wheel drive model the only models sold in the us are 25 and 30 liter awd versions that achieve better frontal crash test results than the fwd european model due to a prop shaft that runs the length of the car from front to rear the prop to the rear supplies power to the rear wheels as well as the front which accounts for the awd traction the modifications made and referred to in iihss report on xtypes made after december 2001 were actually modifications made to fwd european models and are not applicable to the us awd models    thanks jagdude and consumer reports for this information      also note that the reason why the cclass recieved a 5star rating in the european test over the 4star rating that all of the others in this class recieved was because it was the only car that had a flashing light that litup a sign reading the equivalent of fasten your seatbelt on its dash which is to become a standard feature in europe in the future it would have recieved that same 4star rating had it not had the light this is straight off the site      extra points awarded for the way that the cclass reminds its passengers to buckle their seat belts have now made it the second car ever to gain a fivestar crash protection rating results for the cclass were published last year and it achieved four stars but euro ncap has since changed its scoring system to encourage car makers to fit seatbelt warnings      all in all id feel very safe in any one of the cars in this class and i do feel safe being in one of them stay safe everyone,jagboyxtype
59,September 2002,i honestly cannot remember a car ive been in that hasnt had a seatbelt warning light our 87 mercedes benz 420 sel had it and my 99 honda prelude has it maybe this is due to european influence as the ford originally introduced and designed in europe has an obnoxious system that beeps and chimes if the driver does not fasten within an allotted amount of time and other cars ive been in have sensed the weight of a passenger and have flashed the seatbelt light as well i believe the landchrysler does this however as the seatbelt usage stats are dropping in the us maybe this is a good idea after all i can personally attest my safety and my mothers life to seatbelts    btw jagboy the euroncap xtype was a 2002 and it stated that the fwd 20 was released march of that year which is supported by both car and top gear magazines british publications in addition i am relatively certain that the xtype was introduced as an awd model to differentiate it from the mondeo and to keep it from alienating jag owners who may have cringed at the thought of a fwd jag this is from a car article soon before the xtype itself was introduced in may of 2001 however as the base 25 is an already relatively expensive car and does not fare well against a c180 or 318i in terms of value jag decided to introduce the fwd 20 with a stick as standard    from what i understand the driveshaft does assist in distributing the crash impact rearward however the larger engine block of the 30 tends to push rearward earlier in an accident than the smaller block of the 20 with its fewer driveline components obviously as it is fwd so the crumple zones of the 20 have more room to crumple i believe this is the reason why mercedes benz decided to replace the 32 inline 6 of the e class with the smaller block of the 32 v6 in 99 and the difference in crash test scores between a 97 and a 00 are pretty significant although im not sure if mercedes benz conducted any significant changes to the structure since they lowered the hood by an inch,linard
60,September 2002,they double their rigidity with every platform update since its you telling me i believe you but that kinda boggles the mind one would think theres a point where you cant go beyond    wellyes theoretically speaking there is a point where you cant go beyondbut nothin on the face of this earth that has a perfect structural rigidity    we are talking about a large structure on the scale of 100s of centimeters which carries payloads of about 1000 pounds and is subject to stresses incurred by hard braking and acceleration and cornering not to mention the constraints that mass production places on structural rigidity    there is still a lot of flex in even the most rigid of automobiles even full out race cars have problems from structural rigidityi believe the initial audi r8 had multiple problems with body flexparts of the body would pinch and snap hoses and electrical lines    so yes there is tons of room for improvement in all cars in the area of rigidity,wishnhigh1
61,November 2003,interesting comparing apples to apples leasecomparecom gave slightly over a 50 residual on the pontiac5,kdshapiro
62,November 2003,old information it does not reflect what actually happens currently ie not real time such as the awesome tmv sponsored by this site    its a better residual now there is no going back,chrisboth
63,November 2003,probably extremely accurate check it out,kdshapiro
64,November 2003,btwleasecomparecom uses residuals from leasing companies most folks will lease through the manufacturers financing arm and those residuals tend to be much better than those from leasing companies if nmac wants to to subsidise 66 residuals thats ok i am sure the money factor is adjusted for the higher residual anyway so it balances out,speedracer3
65,December 2003,speedracer you are right in cases where companies offer higher residuals they would demand high interest or money factors if youd prefer in my experience the manufacturers own financial company usually gives the higher residuals however beware that even though the monthly payments of highreshighmf  lowreslowmf come out the same if you decide to buy the vehicle at leaseend you would have to pay more for the higher residual personally ive found the residual values on carscom to better reflect what i see on usedcar listings,georgi1
66,December 2003,you decide to buy the vehicle at leaseend you would have to pay more for the higher residual    then one should be buying outright from the beginning leasing for 3 years and then buying is more expensive than buying outright from the beginning,kdshapiro
67,December 2003,as everyone should know nissaninfiniti fortunes have changed completely the last few years including residuals so the past is not much of an indication apparently theres a auto research that predicts five year residuals and obviously pontiac5 is not five year old yet it predicts the g coupe will have the best five year residual in its class which includes bmw    in the nonpremium market nissan residuals are moving closer to the perennial leaders honda  toyota,mariner7
68,January 2004,the 04 tl is rated number 1 in a comparison of 15 near luxury automobiles consumer reports is the most respected publication for reviewing automobiles because they accept no advertising furthermore cr rated acura the number one manufacturer in the world for reliability two months ago based on most recent models 19992001    it was ranked number 1 based on performance luxury sportiness value and reliability,gregory28
69,January 2004,not knocking acura or cr but jd powers website presents different information on reliability just look it up    serious sports sedan enthusiasts recognize inherent limitations of fwd vs rwd yes  so if you want a good value automobile an acura is it actually the best value around is the stripper pontiac5 without leather for 26k for 10k less if you want to drive the best entry level sports sedan in the world its the 3series    btw bmw was given the alg awards for having the highest residual value of any manufacturer you can read about it on their website,kdshapiro
70,January 2004,consumer reports is the most respected publication for reviewing automobiles because they accept no advertising furthermore cr rated acura the number one manufacturer in the world for reliability two months ago based on most recent models 19992001    cr is known for mom and pop minvan level reviews of cars they have no business even driving most enthusiast would probably ignore cr and look to the true auto mags for opinion before buying cr is great for people who know nothing other than what people tell them and want a toyota,chrisboth
71,January 2004,wellll that is your opinion of course others are free to hold their own opinions as im sure you will agree,pat
72,January 2004,any auto reviewer that can state 530i is the best sport sedans ever tested regardless price must know something about automobiles,rhmass
73,January 2004,yep hear ya    but that vehicle probably doesnt fit into the discussion subject here and cr isnt the subject either so lets get back to talking about near luxury performance sedans    and happy new year    ,pat
74,January 2004,i looked at buying a bmw 330i when i was looking at the 04tl i bought the new tl  auto with nav  because the equivelant features on the bmw were 10k more everything was extra i am sure the 330i is a killer ride and will outperform the tl in the twisty parts of the road  but by how much then again even after paying many extra  for the performance packagethe 330i is still down 35hp to the tl i used to road race motorcycles and if i only had a buck for every time i passed people in a corner only to watch them go flying past on the straight because they had more hp how many of you actually drive your cars hard enough in a corner to get the extra benefit of the rwd on the 330i  many of you do however drive fast on the freeway in a relatively straight line or drive in the snow ill take the 10gs and the 35hp and the stereo and the nav and on and on and on,raher
75,January 2004, but by how much     that is exactly the question when you plunk down 35k for a tl when you can get a perfectly acceptable hyundia for 12k you start to ask yourself is the extra 23k worth it is the tl over 3000 better of course it isnt you just like to make yourself feel better when you think your paying less for something that you believe to be equivalent and you are really making out because there is something that cant be used that cost money in the other item but people cant take advantage of it    that is the whole value equation in life for me either ill get the hyundia and pocket the 23k difference or ill spring for the extra 10k,kdshapiro
76,January 2004,righthow could anybody possibly take an unbiased 68 year old publication whos auto test department includes a 327acre stateoftheart test track and autotesting facility that seriously    get real chrisboth your summation of cr is without any factual basis all you have managed to do is compromise your own credibility,kahunah
77,January 2004,how in the world can you compare the price difference between a 12k hyundia and a 35k tl it makes no sense there is no logic to your statement the cars are in two different leagues by your logic why would you even buy the 3 series it is just an entry luxury sedan why not spring for an extra 20000 and get a 5 series sedan or another 35000 and get a 7 series or an audi audi and if you dont want to spring for the extra cash then why did you buy the 3 series in the first place just buy the hyndia you keep talking about,bmwdoug
78,January 2004,calm down bmwdoug youre missing the whole point man    noboby can make outlandish comparisons and generalizations like kd can hes taken playing the devils advocate a whole other level just sit back relax and watch a real master at work dude youll learn something    ok sorry for the interuption kd the floor is your again please tell us the story one more time about how the tl is a communist plot to overthrow this country and the lexus es is our performance sedan savior,shenkar
79,January 2004,dont get into a debate with kd on value because to him if youre not spending the money to drive a bmw you might as well save as much as possible and buy a hyundai    i dont think theres any right answer on value bmw has prestige and road handling that is in a class by itself and if you must have those 2 things then spending the extra money for the bmw is worth it    if prestige does not matter to you and youre happy with a car which handles 90 as well as a bmw then clearly its not worth it to get the bmw    everyones value system and economic means are different and results in different valuations of cars if im making 50 million a year i dont care about a 10k difference in car prices between a bmw and something else its less than 1 of my net worth and ill get what i want if im making 50k a year that extra 10k represents a much greater portion of my income 20 of my net worth and i would not part with it unless i felt the car was 20 better    frankly im sick and tired of the fwd vs rwd debate i have driven a ton of both fwd and rwd cars and just bc a car is rwd doesnt mean it automatically drives better than a fwd car mercedes benz for example makes a pretty fine car and its rwd but most mercedes benzes i have ever driven have not been the greatest handling cars please note that i have not driven every model mercedes benz just going by personal exp so no need to flame me for above statement    for example i had to drive my cousins ml320 this weekend to get more food for my new years party his car was the last one in the driveway so was the only one available    well the seats and the sound system in the ml320 were great the stiff steering the sway in turns and lack of feel on the road were awful i hit double curves at 70 mph in that ml320 to test it out and came out thinking hmmm this was a bad idea the ml320 is a nice luxury car and has a much nicer interior than my acura acura but in terms of handling my fwd acura kicks the rwd ml320,saugatak
80,January 2004,please tell us the story one more time about how the tl is a communist plot to overthrow this country and the es is our performance sedan savior    im not advocating any one car because i think they are both excellent cars for the individual who wants to purchase them    i do like to play devils advocate when someone says why pay top dollar for car x when car y offers almost the same for less and anyway youll never use all of car xs ability thats all well and good but you have to add the four little letters imho who is anybody to suggest to me how i should spend my money and whether a particular car is worth it to me and whether i will or wont derive any added benefit for paying more this train of thought can be applied against any two vehicles    that being said sometimes people will compare vehicles that are not really in the same target market and look at each vehicle on their own merits and then make a choice sometimes it doesnt matter if you get a two or seven seater and you can compare the two seater with the seven seater and each can be good in their own right and a point in time either can satisify your requirements    saugatak  this is not a bmw thread and comparing these two vehicles has nothing to do with bmw i am very mazdar with both cars and each of these are fine vehicles in their own right they offer different qualities that make them very attractive to potential purchasers there is not one worldly overridding value equation that would make anyone jump at one car or another if there were a manufacturer wouldnt be able to give their vehicles away,kdshapiro
81,January 2004,noboby can make outlandish comparisons and generalizations like kd can hes taken playing the devils advocate a whole other level just sit back relax and watch a real master at work dude youll learn something    most people call it being argumentative and find it annoying,saugatak
82,January 2004,saugatak  i am going to respectfully suggest you are missing the point of this whole thing and in the course of not understanding the point you call people argumentative it is not about which car is better because every car has its compromises and after all it is not you that is financing my car its me it is about what is the best car for me the es and tl as every other vehicle each have its plus and minus and im going to make a decision based on what i believe is the right choice for me doesnt matter what cr jd power edmunds you or anybody else says,kdshapiro
83,January 2004,most people call it being argumentative and find it annoying    yeahbut only if you take him seriously why would any thinking individual do that,shenkar
84,January 2004,as far as the rwd vs fwd debate to some people it makes a big difference for whatever the reason is to a particular person a bmw 3 series like the tl like the es is not a one size fits all it depends on what one considers a priority in the vehicle they are purchasing there is no one rightly engineered vehicle,kdshapiro
85,January 2004,nan,gregory28
86,January 2004,shenkar lol    kdshapiro kd you are the only person missing the point so let me spell it out for you    you continually go around demanding that everyone respect your choice of car but you show absolutely no respect for any other persons choice of carunless of course that person chooses a bmw    you continuously make fun of the tl you say that you prefer the looks of a lexus es330 over a tl but you also like the looks of the prebangle and postbangle bmw but dont like the look of pontiac pontiacs real headscratcher you keep saying if youre not getting a bmw buy a hyundai you say the criticism of consumer review is worthless because it ranked the tl over the bmw i didnt notice any such criticism when the bmw was ranked above the tl i mean this list is endless    the only consistent theme in your wildly inconsistent statements is buy bmw do you own shares you keep talking about your objectivity but i dont see it you say every car has tradeoffs and when i ask you what tradeoff the x5 has your response is it doesnt seat seven lol that is scathing criticism    some people have sold their soul to the devil kdshapiro has sold his soul to bmw,saugatak
87,January 2004,there really isnt any comparison between fwd and rwd they may both generate similar track numbers though even that is unlikely but they will do it in an entirely different way when you put 60 or thereabouts of weight up front and have the drive wheels do the steering you will get a different driving experience    as for value the lexus manual is the sleeper you get near 330i performance luxury and equipment for 325i price not to mention reliability warranty customer service etc,riez
88,January 2004,you say the criticism of consumer review is worthless because it ranked the tl over the bmw     i dont know what cr said since the only issue i have is the 2004 auto guide in that issue cr said something like the honda is almost as good as the 2004 tl for 5k less    and ill say it again unabashedlyif you want the best driving dynamics the 3series is the benchmark the 3series isnt for everyone just like the tl isnt for everyone but it is the benchmark in the entry level luxo sports sedan market    you have to choose the vehicle that you feel comfortable with everything else you said in your post is garbage,kdshapiro
89,January 2004,riez i didnt know that the lexus had a stick i will have to take a close look at it thanks for the tip,saugatak
90,January 2004,when i was car shopping in the early 90s i had just been blessed with my first child and was hondaingly shopping for my first family car cr had a shootout involving the honda honda and the toyota toyota the honda hondaing to them had better road feel better acceleration better brakes better handling etc they labelled it the drivers car of the comparison the toyota on the other hand was quieter had better trunk access was slightly larger if i remember correctly etc the toyota won the comparison based on stuff that was mostly unimportant to me but was definitely important to others fwiw i ended up with an nissan but that was based on a financial decision above all else for as reliable as it was i never really liked that car    anyway i think cr is an excellent source of mostly objective info the buyer has to decide what is most important for their driving style and lifestyle take the appropriate cars out for a testdrive and then choose hondaingly,kominsky
91,January 2004,joke what is a fwd porsche a volkswagen what is a fwd bmw an audi what is a fwd bentley a rickshaw    notice that premium marques like bmw excluding the mini brand but that is a unique situation and mb dont use fwd guess their buyers are just uneducated about the benefits of fwd    notice that supercar manufacturers like ferrari aston martin lambro etc dont use fwd guess their buyers are just uneducated about the benefits of fwd    does honda use fwd in its nsx supercar honda knows the difference between fwd and rwd    do mazda and toyota use fwd for performance cars like miata or msubaru they know the difference between fwd and rwd cars,riez
92,January 2004,the honda i can get for 26265k fully loaded    with nav tell me where and ill be there in a flash to purchase it new 0 miles out the door even edmunds tmv estimates about 275k    bmw is the fact that it has the prestige of bmw    lets see honda has value bmw has prestige sort of ignored the equation in the middle why someone would want to purchase any car i could purchase a car much less expensive with much more value than a honda and equal reliability    lets try it this way honda has a reputation for providing value in its cars bmw has a reputation for building cars with a level of luxury and performance thats a much better way of saying honda has value bmw has prestige,kdshapiro
93,January 2004,shenkar  please dont fall into the trap of using sales figures as an estimate of the goodness or best of technology toyota is still the best selling vehicle in america i guess that means its technology sets the standard right fwd reliable appliance right why arent we all buying them,kdshapiro
94,January 2004,riez i agree kd i agree i guess what im trying to get at is the relavance of this fight were having here    i still say for most people driving on public roads in america the realworld performance differences are negligible at bestnonexistent at worst    i currently own both fwd and rwd vehicles and i love them all they all do exactly what i need them to do so does that mean that my rwd mercedes benz sedans are superior to my 04 fwd nissan quest van certainly not based on drivetrain configuration alone    there are a very few situations where one or the other will clearly be preferrable but in most other situations they will be interchangable i just dont believe there are absolutes when discussing the average driver on the average road here in america and id be so bold as to say that includes every single one of us unless you reside in nevada or utah or the like    were fundamentally arguing our preferences and prejudices in the main and i dont see the need for that since they both are valid in most situations,shenkar
95,January 2004,i still say for most people driving on public roads in america the realworld performance differences are negligible at bestnonexistent at worst    the rear drivers will never let this go the driving dynamic is desirable and evident all the time  and i would suggest most of on this board would be above average in our expectations for performance and platform you dont have to go to utah to enjoy the dynamics there may be no merit in arguing which is better f or r drive but there is no way you can say a rwd car is never enjoyed or worth it or needed the cars may be interchangable most of the time if you want to get there but the desirable charachteristics of rwd are there to enjoy all the time and the preference is more than fluff,chrisboth
96,January 2004,i thought this was a forum about bmw 3series but looks like im in the middle of an arguement about fwd vs rwd so ok any comments on how a bmw or any 3 series handles on snowy winding hills such as we have here in western pa i can alway just load up the trunk wsandbagshow about midto long term reliability issues any firsthand experiences with problems after 5 years in a 3 series i understand electrical glitches are very common but not usually very serious,charlew55
97,January 2004,so ok any comments on how a bmw or any 3 series handles on snowy winding hills such as we have here in western pa    change pa to ny or nj and heres my take the handling will be compromised at best without snow tires this applies to any rwd vehicle preferably 4 good snows will make a big difference,kdshapiro
98,January 2004,chrisboth  fwd is a thing of the past  since it is cheaper for manufacturers to use fwd and serves to make smaller and lighter cars which translates to better gas mileage then no you wont see that happen but if i were to entertain your idea for a moment and throw away all benefits to a manufacturer id have to say both rwd and fwd will be in the past and everything will be awd    as far as the rwd vs fwd id like to do as i say above and jump on the side of awd if its good enough for some top supercars and exotics its good enough for me  17 ford crew 27 67 coronet rt 14 towncountry limited 09 lsubaru hse 44car history and counting,qbrozen
99,January 2004,as far as the rwd vs fwd id like to do as i say above and jump on the side of awd    awd does add weight lower fuel efficiency and compromise handling the tradeoff is the ability to handle torque with the loss of balance posed by the additional hardware but to some the tradeoff is worth it,kdshapiro
100,January 2004,and lets not forget the obvious advantage in any conditions other than dry pavement  17 ford crew 27 67 coronet rt 14 towncountry limited 09 lsubaru hse 44car history and counting,qbrozen
101,January 2004,why do you think awd compromises handling  several years ago when audi introduced awd in their german series racing cars they dominated the racing series and attributed it to the awd they were forced to add a great deal of weight to their cars in order to try and make the series fair what part of awd do you feel compromises handling and why ,raher
102,January 2004,the honda i can get for 26265k fully loaded    with nav tell me where and ill be there in a flash to purchase it new 0 miles out the door even edmunds tmv estimates about 275k    265k is the street price of a new exv6 nav check the honda prices board edmunds tmv tends to be conservative the exv6 can be had for 24k itll depend on location it is not out the door since it doesnt take into account taxes title registration etc but the same can be said for any car when comparing prices,jrock65
103,January 2004,who are you talking to i didnt see anyone say that maybe a post was deleted i dunno    oh unless you interpret me saying some of the supercars as meaning most dont well i didnt want to get into an argument about semantics so i was being conservative fact is not all are rwd so obviously highend manufacturers dont necessarily believe rwd is the endallbeall of performance thats all i was saying  17 ford crew 27 67 coronet rt 14 towncountry limited 09 lsubaru hse 44car history and counting,qbrozen
104,January 2004,i was thinking the same thing but then looked up the pontiac5 sedan in both rwd and awd and motortrend lists 651 mph slalom for awd and 659 mph slalom for rwd still extremely close and could easily be attributed to being tested on different days and maybe even different locations and maybe even by a different driver but not provable so there is really no arguing it given 2 identical cars in every other way accept drivetrain configuration the extra weight of awd will most likely lose but again on a dry course oh and also as long as its a car that doesnt have so much power that it would merely smoke the rear wheels while powering out of the turns  17 ford crew 27 67 coronet rt 14 towncountry limited 09 lsubaru hse 44car history and counting,qbrozen
105,January 2004,oh and also as long as its a car that doesnt have so much power that it would merely smoke the rear wheels while powering out of the turns    the new to be e60 bmw 39 to 60 rwd you dont need awd to do it its just another option just like fwd but it does add extra weight reduce gas mileage sure manufacturers have used it to lay power down 4 wheels at a time,kdshapiro
106,January 2004,i was not talking about driving in snow or in the have traffic i was talking about driving at the high speed and passing cars left and right    i also think that you will not be able to achieve more in rwd over fwd i was also asuming that one should have the same experience driving both fwd and rwd you clearly dont have that for example i passed 330 on the i95 the other day and guess what he almost killed himself trying to catch me i was driving my friend rav4 does it mean rav4 is a better car that 330 no it means the guy cant drive with that said i think that 99 of the population will not be able to take advantage of rwd and another 1 race car drivers will be smart enof not to do it,pg48477
107,January 2004,if you live in the north east should you get awd 330 over a rwd 330 if soemone was given a choice what is the downside to choosing the awd if there is any obviously the downside to the rwd is handling in less then clear dry conditions,wrjoyce
108,January 2004,all other things being equal awd adds weight complexity usually price and often eats up some interior or trunk space eg see volkswagen volkswagen of course it can improve traction    but tires are the single most important component for traction get the best tires money can buy    when looking at test results you have to look at what track track conditions drivers tires methodology etc    keep in mind that f1 nascar etc all have arbitrary rules nascar uses live axles and carburetors i cant hardly spell this archaic word much more powerful f1 cars have various restrictions on engine size etc f1 cars in early 1980s put out 1200 hp today they are more like 900 or so hp there is no racing series i know reputable and offical that allows an absolute freeforall for carsany size weight engine size any engine configuration turbos superdodges nitrous oxide or other performance enhancers awd etc would be fascinating,riez
109,January 2004,you right about tires its very important when it comes to handling,pg48477
110,January 2004,if you live in the north east should you get awd 330 over a rwd 330 if soemone was given a choice what is the downside to choosing the awd if there is any obviously the downside to the rwd is handling in less then clear dry conditions    im fairly certain i would have passed on a 330i with awd i dont like the understeer then neutral then oversteer drive feel of an awd car my friends subaru is a fun highly modded car but the awd system makes me very happy to get back into my rwd 330i    additionally im not impressed by the higher maintenance costs lower mileage and added weight btw i live in southern california so awd is really only for the snowboarders and therock climbers not many of us face weather that needs awd,blueguydotcom
111,January 2004,i agree that a well built well designed performance car with rwd is the best handling sedan out there on nonsnowy roads    in 2002 in the northeast when there were a lot of snowstorms rwd cars without snowtires got stuck on the road if my ride were a bmw 330 not an all wheel drive id have to buy at least 2 snow tires for the rear wheels and hang on to them then id have to go to the mechanic to get them installed before the snowstorm hits    oh no everyone else is on line doing the same thing and the mechanic cant get to me too bad now im stuck on snow roads with regular tires in a rwd car oh damn now i just got stuck and have to walk home in 2 foot snow while getting snowsprayed by all the fwd cars going through no problem or better yet i just spun out but before i crashed i was thinking well this is a small price to pay for having a rwd performance car    in ny i drive a fwd car out of choice bc i have gotten stuck in snow in rwd cars but i have never gotten stuck in a fwd car and yes i did have an awd audi but the extra weight on the car made the car really slow and a gas hog    and what happens if i trade in the car and it uses different size tires now i have to get new snow tires and try to sell the old ones good luck getting value for those old snow tires    in sum rwd in a good performance car gives best performance but that dont mean much in snow    awd gives best snow performance but on dry roads its slower the heavier weight of the car affects its turning ability and when you have to do a lot of turning the software on the awd system gets confused so the car acts schizophrenic    fwd doesnt give as good a performance in snow as awd but its usually good enough and its performance on dry roads is second to rwd but better than awd and it usually has the best gas mileage    i think that manufacturers will continue to make fwd rwd and awd cars to suit different tastes and climates since the camcord are the best selling cars and theyre fwd plus they show no signs of giving up the sales crown i disagree with your contention that fwd cars are a thing of the past,saugatak
112,January 2004,check out the february 2004 issue of cr    as they put it most of their favorite v6 family sedans like the honda toyota and volkswagen scored higher in our tests than most of the vehicles in this category and they cost about 3000 to 9000 less    if you want to see how the 330i and lexus stack up you have to pull out the may 2001 issue of cr    speaking of tires    330i was nonsport pkg and rode on 20550subaru7 93v mediocre continental contitouringcontact tires    tl rode on bridgestone turanza el42 p23545subaru7 93w tires    lexus rode on goodyear eagle gsd 21545zsubaru7 87w tires    for those who love numbers with each being tested with an automatic transmission    600 mph dry braking lexus 128 ft tl 130 ft and 330i 131 ft    avoidance maneuver lexus 57 mph 330i 555 mph and tl 525 mph    060 mph 330i 66 secs tl 67 secs and lexus 74 secs    4565 mph tl 42 secs lexus 44 secs and 330i 53 secs    14 mile 330i 151 secs tl 152 secs and lexus 157 secs    cr clearly points out that the tl cannot handle like the 330i or lexus    overall fuel economy tl 23 mpg 330i 22 mpg and lexus 21 mpg    predicted reliability lexus best rating with tl and 330i getting next best rating in original test in todays data lexus retains best rating and 330i has fallen to only average reliability    interesting that of the 15 cars in their upscale sedan category the fwders finished 1st 4th 9th 10th 11th 14th and 15th the rwders finished 2nd 3rd 5th 6th 8th and 12th the awders finished 7th and 13th say the rwders win this one,riez
113,January 2004,the tls biggest handicap vs the lexus and 330i isnt its drivetrain its curb weight,fedlawman
114,January 2004,fwd is inherently front heavy and it asks the drive wheels to steer fwd cannot overcome the laws of physics which is one reason there is no fwd supercar    a fwder and rwder of the same total weight will not have that weight evenly distributed that weight distribution penalty causes an inherent disadvantage    and since the best tires can go on any vehicle the fwder cannot overcome its limitations by using better rubber,riez
115,January 2004,were all of the vehicles equipped the same  as in all had manual trans  the car and driver test of the tl showed much better 060 times   57 as i recall and i know it was the manual trans much worse braking  180 some feet i think  a nice set of comparison numbers you put together however,raher
116,January 2004,cr road test all vehicles have at    riez i think we all agree that tires men a lot when it comes to handling  here is some stats for you    bridgestone turanza el42 p23545subaru7 93w  handling rating  580 dry traction  630 wet traction  51  goodyear eagle gsd 21545zsubaru7 87w tires handling rating  880 dry traction  920 wet traction  910  contitouringcontact 20550subaru7 93v tires handling rating  830 dry traction  870 wet traction  77    the number are based on 10 point system and taken from tire rack    as you can see tl has the worse tires by far this is why tl scored marginally lover in handling and accelerations tests plus as somebody mentioned tl is also heavier    with that said  if you put the same tires on all three vehicles you will get almost identical numbers in handling,pg48477
117,January 2004,raher i wrote for those who love numbers with each being tested with an automatic transmission they were all tested by cr with 5speed automatic transmissions    do keep in mind that you have to pay careful attention to the test methodology if you study the fine print of rt mt and cd youll see how they do theirs tells how they achieve maximum 060 mph times eg high rpm drop clutch and whether they publish actual results what they did that day on that track at that altitude at that temperature or adjusted results mathematically altering the data for temperature etc thinking cd and mt publish adjusted results and rt publishes actual results also thinking rt discusses how results within a certain range are essentially statistically not different i prefer their methodology even though cd is much more enjoyable to read,riez
118,January 2004,ppontiac8477 not mazdar with these numbers what is their methodolgy are these objective numbers eg each tire is tested on the same car with the same driver on the same track at the same temperature etc or subjective guestimates    do you happen to know the dot grades temperature wear and traction for each of these tires    the contitouringcontacts are not a performance tire continental contisportcontacts and contisportcontact 2s are continentals highest performing tires my wifes 00 323ia had the tourings i put a set of sportcontact 2s on my 98 540i6 world of difference    crs 330i would have handled and braked much better if it had had the optional sport pkg which it did not the sport pkg provides improved suspension setting and better tires eg a tire like the sportcontact,riez
119,January 2004,youll notice that the tl rode on the widest tires 235 mm much much wider than the 330is a mere 205 mm and much wider than the lexuss just 215 mm tire width means bigger contact patch all other things equal a wider tire should improve braking and most handlingrelated numbers    in the realm of tires a 30 mm width difference is like the grand canyon thinking 25 mm is approx 1 inch,riez
120,January 2004,you right tl has wider tires but its not always good why you think most powerful rwd cars have thinner tires on the front wheels it gives some but it also takes some    as for tire rack data i dont know how they came up with it but i know that tire rack is one of the best stores when it comes to tires if you want go to tirerackcom and get all details you need,pg48477
121,January 2004,as reiz pointed out if you can afford a car in this class and its upkeep the difference between 25 and 30 mpg isnt going to be a real big factor    honestly though these cars are in the range for other vehicles their size engine size and weight but wouldnt you rather get 23 around town than 17 unless you buy a v12 forced air high performance whatever in the 3 to 35l range there is no reason good performance has to come at the expense of fuel economy and emissions what with the evo cited in enthusiast mags about getting 14mpg if thats your bag fine right now it aint mine,kdshapiro
122,January 2004,i dont think that fuel millage is very important when buying a car  but on the other hand for 30 engine and only 220hp sound like realy low millage plus the car is not that heavy,pg48477
123,January 2004,have anybody here considered volvor not many people talking about it but looks like a grate car,pg48477
124,January 2004,i dont think that fuel millage is very important when buying a car    when youre fuel bills are 350 dollars a month because you drive a lot of mileage and get lousy economy you might change your mind but of course we each have our own priorities,kdshapiro
125,January 2004,i drove a v8 pickup for a few years to condition myself before buying a sporty sedan anything that gets over 20 mpg is an economy car to me i seldom even check the mileage any more one of the beauties of not having a trip computer is you dont have to deal with as much guilt just gas and go,jmess
126,January 2004,well first of all horsepower has little to do with acceleration its all about top speed acceleration is about torque and not just peak torque but the whole area under the torque curve the tl achieves 238 lbft  5000 rpm while the bmw achieves 214 lbft  3500 rpm so there is only 24 lb ft of difference in the peak torque but the bmw acheives it much earlier an earlier torque peak generally means a much broader and flatter torque curve in general less peaky it also generally means less peak hp which explains the large hp difference    and second of all the engine is not alone power is tdodgesitted to the ground via the gearing of the transmission and the final drive axle gear spacing affects acceleration by allowing the engine to stay longer between its peak torque and peak hp the first gear ratio also needs to be selected so as to deliver maximum power without overpowering the wheels and tires that will deliver the force to the ground    all that being said i listed the bmw pontiac5 and tl because they are approximately equal in all the acceleration testing i have seen there seems to be just as large a variation in the times of different pontiac5s for instance as there is a variation between the three different models,cybersol
127,January 2004,the rx is based on the toyota    the lexuss lowish highway fuel economy estimate is due to its gearing it does not use a very deep overdrive 5th gear id prefer a deeper overdrive but you hardly have to shift out of 5th in order to pass the lexus is performance car not an economy car designed for drivers who even want performance in 5th gear    just compare the gearing in the toyota and rx versus the lexus taking into account both final drive ratio and the individual ratio of each gear    if you want to complain check out the mileage differences between the 325i and 330i the less powerful 325i isnt very fuel efficient and part of that problem is tied to its gearing as well as a smallish engine for the cars weight,riez
128,January 2004,unless you buy a v12 forced air high performance whatever in the 3 to 35l range there is no reason good performance has to come at the expense of fuel economy and emissions what with the evo cited in enthusiast mags about getting 14mpg if thats your bag fine right now it aint mine    whats that song on the pulp fiction sountrack about a preacher man its in my head right now for some reasonwhatever kds drives is the right amount of gas mileage to be getting to not be over polluting with emissions and about the right gas mileagesick the toyota board on him if mileage is a concern you will always compromise yourself out of the next class up wont you 300400 hp 45k cars babyfuggeda about the flippin gas  we live in the us people,chrisboth
129,January 2004,well i cant believe i got thru the thread i have to say i used to have an lexus and it was ok i used it as a daily beater for me it was a good commuter car certainly not comfortable for long rides and not quick enough to toy with people stoplight to stoplight it handled well but no better than the audi i had i bought it used for a great price and i must say it was damn reliable but above all this the reason i got rid of it was because of the type of people that drive them most not all are juveniles or act like it and swear up and down its the best vehicle since the model t was introduced at least now ive dumped it and i dont have these clowns coming up to me asking me what mods it has ,g17

132,January 2004,there is one other sportcross and 3 lexus sedans that regularly cut through my neighborhood i have never seen anyone under 30 driving one of them    i am 51 and i kind of like the way the younger women react to my lexus sportcross the trouble is they are more interested in the car than me i even have some mods to talk about if one of them asks    it is kind of sad to get so mature that you worry about being associated with juveniles i think i will try and avoid that condition as long as possible,jmess
133,January 2004,so we are to worry about who else might like and drive the same car    bmw owners are always tarnished as snobs or yuppies mb owners as aloof intelligensia  volvos and saabs as chevrolet soccer moms or savethewhale crowd japanese premium marques as boring and playing it safe jaguar as being tothemanorborn    this must rule out most porsche and chevrolet owners who obsess about performance and improving their cars performance not to mention all the ford firebird chevrolet etc people who love to do mods not to mention the entire tuner crowd and their honda etc    but then again when i used to have my 96 chevrolet ss and was a member of the major owner clubs state and nationally when we got together all we talked about were mods performance tuning etc and we were the 3050 crowd    guess people are more alike than not people who love cars love performance and want the best that might mean some mods    and yeah trd and others have some nice mods for the lexus that is a problem for anyone here,riez
134,January 2004,well said,shipo
135,January 2004,it will always be the samehow fast do you want to go  how much money have you got ,raher
136,January 2004,riez i agree with you 100 you cant even judge someones wealth by the cars they drive i know plenty of wealthy people who treat cars like a cost lets face it its probably the most rapidly depreciating asset you can own and will gladly buy a camcord beat on it for 7 years and then buy another one    others dont have much but put all their cash into cars and skimp on everything else or they buy a used car for cheap you can never tell,saugatak
137,January 2004,others dont have much but put all their cash into cars and skimp on everything else or they buy a used car for cheap you can never tell    and others have a lot and they have fleets of high price over 100k automobiles so in essence we have    1 people with little acquiring inexpensive automobiles  2 people with little acquiring expensive automobiles  3 people with wherewithall acquiring inexpensive autmobiles  4 people with wherewithall acquiring expensive automobiles    which makes you feel better,kdshapiro
138,January 2004,what a rhetorical question of course its always better to be young rich and healthy than old poor and sick  everything else comes in between and depends on priorities abilities and circumstances,mohatu
139,January 2004,what a rhetorical question of course its always better to be young rich and healthy than old poor and sick    correct and id rather be old poor and sick than dead,kdshapiro
140,January 2004,im hoping to be old rich healthy driving an bmw and ummm errr how can i say this ummm in the mood     best regards  shipo,shipo
141,January 2004,dont you think people see their car as projecting their lot in life or is there a disconnect for most people philosophy of consumerism,buddhabman
142,January 2004,i dont know about thatwe just all want the biggest  and want to brag we have it    imo the people who have biggest baddest cars  way more than we are paying for entry lux sedans  are the ones who if they hadnt spent all the  would be millionares and look like they are while the ones who drive an honda may just be millionaires as they have been prudent but seem to be the avg joe    the wealthiest people i know act like they are poor and drive volkswagens and vans the best looking cars i can point to in any friends garage well that guy is buying gas on his credit card so he can afford the payment    and some in my fam think im an asss for buying a 35k carto them i say  its 3k more than the loaded volkswagen i thought was prudentand i get 10 times that in value from the pleasure it gives me to drive itmost of us on a board like this probably actually are nuts about cars,chrisboth
143,January 2004,way more than we are paying for entry lux sedans  are the ones who if they hadnt spent all the  would be millionares     not truei waited long time before i got my car and i could have afforded one back in the day due to smart investing    the wealthiest people i know act like they are poor and drive volkswagens and vans    some of the ones i know drive rollsto each their own,kdshapiro
144,January 2004,one friend of mine owns 11 car dealerships and one bank he is very wealthy and drives a 1999 chevrolet s10 pickup truck    another friend of mine cant rub two nickels together and at the time of purchase he was unemployed he has a 2001 bmw bmw    i actually did a research project on this same topic for a psychology class with test subjects between the ages of 18 and 50 and the only hard conclusions i could come too was that the younger drivers made their purchases based on the status that particular name brand brought them and the older drives were more apt to makes their purchases based upon performance and driveability    personaly i want looks performance handeling and every possible toy inside for a reasonable price which is why i purchased my 04 tl with nav,aciampi
145,January 2004,it can go either way     it goes all different ways all of the time    i wanted a bmw for the longest time and finally got one there is no turning back and no substitute it may be not be the most luxorious or fastest but what it does it does best and thats what i love about it,kdshapiro
146,January 2004,i too thought i wanted a bmw but bounced on the price and lack of lsd in the 330 i could have easily dealt with the price but i couldnt forgive bmw for leaving out the lsd so it was pretty easy to buy the lexus where things like hids premium sound and metallic paint are standard equipment the lsd was a 330 option quite a bargain,jmess
147,January 2004,dont you think people see their car as projecting their lot in life or is there a disconnect for most people philosophy of consumerism    i hate what my bmw represents to too many people i drive an 03 pro most often and only use the bimmer on the weekends even then ive had many people ask me if the 330i is my car as im loading things into it and such guess my usual weekend dishevled appearance doesnt jive with the concept of a bimmer owner    shirt with holes unshaven barely brushed hair and frayedworn shortsjeans fits my usual weekend look    btw someone mentioned paying cash for gas thats just silly credit cards give you cash back and or rewards for using them using the card is free the expenses will be incurred anyway so why not get something for your expenditures i use cash as little as possible because the return on cash is nothing but the product    lastly id agree with kd ive wanted a bimmer since 98 when the current bodysetup hit the streets i drove everything and ended up with the car that i think fits me perfectly nothing quite like loving your car,blueguydotcom
148,January 2004,i hate what my bmw represents to too many people    lets extend that concept i hate what rolls is to many people i hate what ferrari is to many people i hate what maybach is to many people i hate what mercedes benz is to many pvolkswagenubaruh well i could go on    like it or not its a diverse world thank the lord the amount of money any one person has does not affect the handling of any one car that is what we are really discussing here right    one car vs another not one car buyers money vs another car buyers money or one car buyers snobbishness vs another car buyers snobbishness    it makes you feel really good to say due to jealously imho theres a person worth a fortune driving a 10 year old hyundai some people flaunt it some dont either way its theirs to do with as they want and ill do with mine what i want buy the car i want for my own reasons,kdshapiro
149,January 2004,kd you are right as always different strokes for different folks and different people buy and drive different cars for different reasons just as some guys prefer blondes but others prefer brunettes but you got to get rid of your 10 year old hyundai example because that is a cheap unreliable unsafe pos which imho is not preferred by anyone except for those who cannot afford something better ,kennyg5
150,January 2004,kdyou got to get rid of your 10 year old hyundai example because that is a cheap unreliable unsafe pos which imho is not preferred by anyone except for those who cannot afford something better    now thats what im saying thank youuu kennypontiac ,shenkar
151,January 2004,i didnt bring it into the mix  the thoroughly impressed gt3 driver did obviously several iterations of this arguemnt can cause a loss of ford    you lexus thing is a good idea except to date nothing in the lineup is impressive and i just heard the supra was going to be too expensive and they canned it for reasons similar to the first canning in the 90s not a lot of toyota rd goes into fm type platforms or sports cars its all subject to change im sure    a rwd acura and better branded rwd lexus if done properly would trounce the z on the japan inc playing field i hope nissan is watching because lexus knows    now you are comparing to cars that dont exist yetby the time those come off the drawing board  nissan will have the gtr out and and m45 but if theres something out there that rocks the auto world like the g ill be the first in line i love a benchmark blaster  bring me more,chrisboth
152,January 2004,i was just chatting with some old 5 series owners at my fav forum  theres a thead about 5 owners converting to g and its pretty interestingespecially the 540 converts who wished theyd put the extra 300 a month into a house or fund    present value of 300 a month for 48 months at 7 is about 12500,chrisboth
153,January 2004,present value of 300 a month for 48 months at 7 is about 12500    correct thats why some people i know instead of buying lexus infiniti bmw buy hyundai present value of 25000 for 10 years is what you dont have to skip buying a 540 to save money you can skip buying infiniti also and save a bundle at the end buy that bmw for cash    come on chris  people who are really serious about saving money dont even buy cars over 1011k much less buying a bmw or infiniti,kdshapiro
154,January 2004,come on kd  people who get the 5 get lux gooidies and granted some substance but not 12k worth imo if hyundia puts up a g beater ill be the first in line especially if it saves me money id pay 25k for a loaded h35 if it runs like g 35,chrisboth
155,January 2004,there is no point of dragging one opinion to one xtreme side just like my dad told me dont eat too much otherwise you will become fat so i wont eat at all thats not gonna work    you can buy any car which suited you best compare all the goodness and the bad and get the best value of it    some people prefer the best brand name in the market some people like one of the best brand name and others just doesnt care about brand best brand name does not always come with more features more luxury better performance etc besides there is no absolute answer for which brand is actually the best    car is one of the worst investment and investment doesnt mix well with this thread,danny1878
156,January 2004,you going over board with nissaninfiniti brand they just caught up with the market by making one car pontiac5z350 dont forget this is the only car that worth talking everything else infiniti builds is a bust pontiac5 is not better performance car than 3 series and does not have overall value of tl i think that infiniti has a long way to go,pg48477
157,January 2004,fwiw ive read the posts over the last few days with some amusement what a great world we live in if youve got 3040k to spend on a car huh bmw audi infiniti acura caddywhatever things just keep getting better huh    i just traded my 99 bmw e46 for a pontiac5x i absolutely loved the bmw but the abs pump went and i figured the 2500 repair price was a good excuse to go shopping before that the car was rocksolid never a problem really    the pontiac5x was just the best value for me out there its beautiful imho of course has awd and a great engine with more power but not as smoothrevving as my bmw while also giving me more room than my bmw oh and it was about 6k less than the comparable 3series today 330ix although i dont think the 6k is all prestige  theres definitely something special about a 3    i testdrove the acura tl and its a pretty amazing bargain didnt care for the fwd feel or the dealers in my area or id probably be driving one today interior is amazing puts infiniti and bmw to shame during my test drives for what its worth the engine didnt feel as good as the pontiac5s but a test drive isnt a great place to evaluate such things cars need about several thousand miles on them before the engines loosen up    anyway the bmw with sport and summer tiresfelt lighter and more chevrolet than my new pontiac5x but the pontiac5x feels more powerful and rides better both are awesome cars    one other note about all of the posted tests from magazines i love reading about cars but the comparos really are sometimes apples to oranges for example bmw are always tested with the sport package and summer tires usually honda most other cars are tested with allseason tires mention is rarely made of that difference it certainly must account for some of the skidpad and steering response results in bmw defense they have the guts to put topflite performance tires on their cars so they should get creditnot like the crap turanza el42s that came on my pontiac5x    anyhow my overall point is that after having owned a bmw 3 for over five years and extensively test driving an audi audi acura tl and pontiac5x i can say that i honestly think i could have been incredibly happy with any of these four cars if caddy can get their buildquality up im sure they will be another player for those who dont think theres something special about a 3series bmw you really need to own one for a while i fell in love and might very well find myself back in a bmw down the line the pontiac5x is a different and amazing car though and for me its the best of whats out there today    heck even if youre looking in the 25k range you have the volkswagen mazdaudi honda nissan and toyota    whatever you choose in whichever class what a great time to be car shopping,rderizans
158,January 2004, im sure it was an auto and im sure the poor guy just pressed on the gas real hard and his skills didnt get in the way too bad check another stat on the g and compare  5070 and 560 numbers are very good for the z car platform you guys may find value in many things about many cars  i find value in the thrust and handling that no other car can best in class     no problem with the latter part of this about the pontiac5 but the 540i surely isnt in the gs class its several classes above it and in the hands of a skilled driver the pontiac5 doesnt have a prayer with a 540i    it really doesnt say much for the g to be compared to the porsche 928 especially since the car was designed in the seventies there used to be a website called httpwww4carcouk and they had all kinds of comparos such as the one youve made here before their demise they had a test in which the audi s6 euro model only xjr pre 04 and bmw were competing with a used to be untouchable ferrari the 512tr which started out as the testarossa in the 1980s and guess whatthe bmw beat the ferrari in every measure point being that cars simply advance i dont know what a 350z would do other than get humiliated by a 911 gt3 i can mention a sl55 amg in same breath as an carrera gt in some areas bit that doesnt mean the sl55 is comparable overall    m,merc1
159,January 2004,the bmw beat the ferrari in every measure    i recognize the 5 is a couple notches higher than the g  but im stating that performance alone transcends class which is not based on size and displacement but on lux items and ride quality hey i want an bmw as much as anyonesee some of my past posts the edmunds home page today has the pontiac5 review from archives and it specifically mentions the target as the 540i  as well as the bmw    whoever suggested infiniti has a long way  hello  infiniti and 45 which are porsche beaters fir 40k less upcoming m45  which exists in japan now things we arent fortuante enough drive here like the skylines and gtrs theres enough here to keep me happy    pontiac5 is not better performance car than 3 series     have you just joined us,chrisboth
160,January 2004,i agree performance does transcend classes by my point is that if youre just looking for speed a z28 ss will outrun all of the cars pontiac5 540i etc but it doesnt compare overall the pontiac5 is a hell of a car of which the coupe i will be considering but compared to a 5series overall its not in the same league just because infiniti mentions the 5series and bmw as targets doesnt mean theyve met those targets imo and experience with both cars theyve fallen short of a normal 5series overall and its too surreal to even think about a pontiac5 competeing with a bmw    m,merc1
161,January 2004,the target was the 540 and the old bmw not bmw,chrisboth
162,January 2004,considering the success of the pontiac5 i would not put it past nissaninfiniti to put out a performance version of the pontiac5 we all know that the vaudi5 can be tuned for more hp unless ofcourse they dont want to outdo the 350z or the upcoming gtr,speedracer3
163,January 2004,first fx is not a car its an suv and second it does not sell that well m45 did not came out yet so as i said they do have a long long way to go    i joined this threat a while ago maybe before you did i know that you think pontiac5 is better than 3 series does not mean that its true,pg48477
164,January 2004,for those that havent read it this is how they stacked up    35k sport sedans all stick shift    in rank order    1 infiniti pontiac5  2 bmw 325i  3 acura tl the new one  4 lexus lexus  5 audi audi 30 audi  6 saab 93 arc,speedracer3
165,January 2004,personally id put the volvo volvo t5 on that list before the audi but hey its all about personal preferences right  17 ford crew 27 67 coronet rt 14 towncountry limited 09 lsubaru hse 44car history and counting,qbrozen
166,January 2004,how did you came up with this list does not look right please post a link,pg48477
167,January 2004,speedracer3 check out how consumer reports ranks them 3 series and lexus at top pontiac5 near bottom thinking pontiac5 was around 10th or 12th out of the 15 cars in their category for this segment    not sure where you got the purported cd rankings the cd comparisons ive read tested the 330i with the pontiac5 and lexus are you citing a recent comparison test or looking at different tests thinking the last published complete cd test of 325i manual was around january 2001,riez
168,January 2004,riez is right consumer reports ranked tl first 330 second and pontiac5 was in a bottom 5 out of 15 cars,pg48477
169,January 2004,riez is right consumer reports ranked tl first 330 second and pontiac5 was in a bottom 5 out of 15 cars    and pg is correct also however cr did say the handling on the 330i was better now why did i get that model    they will not review the 3 series until the next revamp however i suspect if the zhp had been reviewed the tl would still have won on the value component but the zhp would have mopped up the performancehandling aspect now why would one buy a zhp,kdshapiro
170,January 2004,the latest car  driver rated the manual versions as pontiac5 325 tl lexus audi 93 arc xtype 30    in the sports sedan category the tl gets hurt by fwd they eliminated the 330 from the test due to price    the lexus did well considering it had the lowest price and all the other cars were newer designs,jmess
171,January 2004,the lexus did well considering it had the lowest price and all the other cars were newer designs    ummm last time i checked the lexus came out in 2001 and the e46 3series came out in 1999 how does that make a 325i a newer design than the lexus    best regards  shipo,shipo
172,January 2004,i think the is was introd in the us the summer 2000 as a 2001 prior to that it was sold in japanasia as the toyota altezza for a couple of years here is a picture of a 98    httpenglishautovlrucatalopontiacyotaaltezza199810photo    your right about 1999 for the e46 the first ones were the 323  328 and then they changed engines in 2000 much to the chagrin of the 99 owners,jmess
173,January 2004,i cant find the link that showing the new chart the only thing that i found is pontiac5 coupe as 10 best car 2004    this is quoted from infinitycom  pontiac5 wins 2004 car and driver 10best award 01062004 the pontiac5 is once again recognized as one of the years 10best cars from car and driver which looks for stunning styling terrific technology and excellent value in its winners hondaing to car and driver the pontiac5 pushes all the right buttons to renew its 10best membership    they eliminated the 330 from the test due to price they dont want tl cuz of fwd and they put 325 in second place while its stats for 060 is above 7 secs what were they comparing if not for speed luxury price rwd,danny1878
174,January 2004,from that perspective i think that the 3series might still be older i seem to remember that the e46 went on sale in europe in late 1997 or early 1998    yes no    best regards  shipo,shipo
175,January 2004,first fx is not a car its an suv    its built on the fm platform the same as the pontiac5 and its most certainly not an offroading vehicle its closer to what bmw calls an sav semantics    and second it does not sell that well    nissaninfinitis consistently moving about 3k fxs a month thats about the same as the pontiac5 sedan    m45 did not came out yet    funny the m45s ive seen on the road seem to say otherwise nissan sells only a few hundred a month though the new m isnt out yet but the same old one is still selling    im a fan of bmw heck i own one but theres no reason to make up things about infiniti    shipo yeah the current bmw 3 has been kicking around for eons the first ones to hit us shores were in 98 bmw sure takes its time with redesigns not that im upset as i love the look of my 3    kd wrote but the zhp would have mopped up the performancehandling aspect now why would one buy a zhp    not sure why any fool would buy a zhp oh wait maybe we love the 3 package but wanted something a bit more raw and as close to an bmw as we could get with 4 doors i still lust after that 32 though,blueguydotcom
176,January 2004,duh i had a bmw built in 1998     best regards  shipo,shipo
177,January 2004,no links go to your newstand and pick up the march 2004 issue of car and driver sorry if the list upset some of you but i can assure i didnt come up or make up the list please dont shoot the messanger if you dont like message,speedracer3
178,January 2004,does riez ever have a post that doesnt mention the lexus     just a question,g17
179,January 2004,not really surprised the tl did not win considering their utter hatred of fwd but take a look at the chart that comes up with the points the tl is winning by around 6 points through all the categories and loses at the end because of 2 utterly subjective things    gotta have it factor  fun to drive    okay i will give them the fun to drive one as a valid point to have in a comparison but what the hell is the gotta have it they ranked the audi below the infiniti which i am sorry i think it is much more prestigious to have an audi vs an infiniti but these 2 categories bumped the tl down 2 spots,95gt
180,January 2004,out did a 04 tl i find that very amusing    i think my automatic 03 tls will beat this car in most category    oh by the way that is why i did not renew my subscription with them    too partial to bimmers,billyperks
181,February 2004,i think its funny you need to go into all sorts of things to prove car a is better car b car a and car b are both fine vehicles but car b is the benchmark sorry if you dont like that conclusion by the collective automotive opinion its not my opinion its theirs,kdshapiro
182,February 2004,actually you are a good debateraggresive you make this board alive im kinda addicted to this board debating is a healthy way to exercise our brain none of my statement are personals they are just fun thoughts and i still love bmw infinity lexus etc in their respective ways    i agree with car b as the benchmark although sometimes the facts vary as in cr cd etc,danny1878
183,February 2004,actually you are a good debater    i appreciate that and you have put forth some compelling factsopinions as well i always enjoy trading posts as long as they are about the vehicles and the industry and not the vehicles owners    i actually wish i could have one of each of the aforementioned vehicles in my driveway as they all have their strengths on the road a different driving experience if you will for different times    there are times for example crawling to work at 10mph for an hour and a half the dvda really appeals to me but then for those rare times the roads are clear im very happy to be in my car feeling like the dang thing is on rails anticipating my every move while i am in pothole avoidance mode,kdshapiro
184,February 2004,the tl has everything the 6speed for example is a premiumsport package with more horsepower faster slalom times and lsd for thousands less than a fully optioned 330 sport premium kitchen sink whatever,kahunah
185,February 2004,car b is the benchmarkbut for how long    car a for its bigger engine does not translate into faster 060 330 hondaing to cd gets to 60 faster than the tl braking is superior as well i believe it also beat the tl in the 14 mile the bmw which is a 3series after all for the same size engine as the tl is another story altogether with its 47 060 the tl is a great sporty sedan if you dont mind a little torque steer the handling of the 330 is just better skidpad is better as well i doubt the tl will best the slalom of the zhp though with its bmw like handling    so if all you want to do all day long is go around cones the tl is the car for you,kdshapiro
186,February 2004,nan,cjs2002
187,February 2004,my thats great my fathers the same way about me getting my new car he wants me to get a bmw or a mb nothing else can compare he makes me lauph he cant even fit into the 3 series too tall cant get comfy but he wants me to get that or the mb c230 sedan also cant sit comfy go figure but there mb and bmw so nothing can beat them,cjs2002
188,February 2004,he makes me lauph he cant even fit into the 3 series too tall cant get comfy    my fathers 61 and he had no problems getting comfy in the front seats,kdshapiro
189,February 2004,go out and run 100 miles on a winding road in both cars and i think you would appreciate the 330 more fwd cars when driven hard over heat the front tires and start to push more and more the torque steer requires more driver effortattention to manage anyone who has raced fwd cars has to learn how to manage the tires and the inevitable mid race increase in push a rwd car takes a lot less effort to drive at speed and puts less load on the front tires    as so many have pointed out already there is so much more to cars that what can be measured with 060 or a 600ft slalom course if you took 10 highly skilled drivers and asked them which car tl or 330 they would take for a little 2 hour race tl vs 330 i would be surprised if any of them choose the tl i raced fwd cars for 10 years and i know what car i would take,jmess
190,February 2004,try doing that in the dead of winter and see which car finishes first hows that paul simon song go slip sliding away the original working title of that song was rwd in february,kahunah
191,February 2004,just a point that many seem to be unaware of regarding the bmw sport package it does make a difference i think but much more so on the 325i than the 330i the suspension on the 330i is the same regardless of whether you get the sport package or not it already has the upgraded suspension the only chassisrelated difference is wheels same 17 size though i think and of course bigger summer performance tires    the 325i has a softer base suspension    dont get me wrong  the bmw sport pkg seatsis great i had a 99 bmw that i just traded in a few weeks ago im just saying that it probably doesnt transform the car as much as people are saying in the case of the 330i or the coupes which also come standard with the firmer suspension and anyone who has driven a 325i without the sport package and claims it isnt fun and still dynamically headandshoulders above most of the competition hasnt really driven one its still a great car    before i get labeled as a blind bmwlover my new car is an infiniti pontiac5x  loved my bmw but the value prop for the g was just too high to pass up,rderizans
192,February 2004,try doing that in the dead of winter and see which car finishes first hows that paul simon song go slip sliding away the original working title of that song was rwd in february    it has long seemed that when the fwd advocates run out of arguments about why their beloved fwd configuration is superior they always turn to how well their cars perform in snow hey yall had me fooled to the point where i left behind rwd cars in 1979 and didnt start driving them again until 1999 so ill start out with a few well chosen words regarding how much better fwd cars perform in snow vs rwd cars    1 assuming the assertion is in fact true who cares i mean how much snow do you really drive in anyway  2 sorry guys it just aint so    hondaing to a very interesting test run a couple of years back by one of the car magazines it is in fact true that under light acceleration the fwd car will perform better in snow than an otherwise similar rwd car unfortunately for the fwd crowd thats where the performance advantages end rwd cars with their naturally better balance ie foreaft weight distribution reigned supreme in the handling and braking department awd cars were a different story however the rwd cars with their lighter relative weight still stopped better after all who cares about getting going if you cannot stop or turn    i am now driving a rwd car with a nearly perfect 5050 weight distribution traction control and winter tires and i can say without a doubt that it is the finest winter weather driving car i have ever driven given what chris bangle has done to bmw i have no idea what my next car will be however i can assure you that even though i live in snowy new hampshire it will be rwd    best regards  shipo,shipo

194,February 2004,i think that you and i are singing from the same page of the song book regarding the visual disaster that is the new e60 5series oddly enough i actually like the new 6series specifically the 645ci however from a financial point of view college tuition for the kids and such im not too sure its in my future    best regards  shipo,shipo

200,February 2004,2004 estimated 3year resale values source alg    1 bmw 545  2 lexus 532  3 acura 521  4 mb 52  5 audi 512  6 infiniti 511    i got a question if the average bmw sells for 95 of msrp and the average infiniti sells for 90 of msrp arent real world resale values approximately the same 51190  54595  57,jrock65
201,February 2004,jrock65 those are purely guestimates the actual numbers wont be know for years when real owners go to sell their cars or trade them in the industry has done a horrible job projecting depreciation which impacts both leases and nonlease purchases for the past decade or more trend had been to inflate plus manufacturers sometimes artificially inflate residual in order to subsidize the lease then they take a bath 3 years down road when their dealers are wholesaling the lease returns    realized depreciation really best applies to the person who buys the car new and then sells it later their actual realized depreciation is the difference between what they actually paid which is usually below msrp and what they actual get for resale which is usually below the published books msrp is normally meaningless to depreciation unless that is the price paid at time of purchase,riez
202,February 2004,yes these are estimates but i dont believe that theyre worthless if im buying a car now theres no way to know for sure what itll sell for in the future these estimates do serve as some sort of guide however imperfect they are    the tense of my question should be in the future tense,jrock65
203,February 2004,guess it really depends on whether you plan on leasing or buying and how long you plan on keeping the car these guestimates wont matter a whit if you buy the car outright keep it for a decade and drive the wheels off of it nor will they matter if you are leasing and get a great subsidized lease deal from the manufacturer where they deliberately overestimate residuals in order to lower less payment    of course these estimates do matter when it comes to calculating a lease deal today but ive never leased and cant imagine ever doing so    but i also think these estimates can be dangerous for people who buy and then plan on trading in or selling off their car in say 25 years these numbers are almost always over what you will actually receive from a dealer or private party to be safe deduct at least an extra 10 if not more like 25    give you an example on 113001 i bought a cpo 98 540i6 had about 52k miles original msrp was around 58k i paid about 36k i traded her in 903 at about 78k miles got about 19k from dealer so my actual depreciation for the 22 months and 26k miles i owned her was about 17k the dealer who bought it from me sold it for about 22k so the car at 78k miles5 years was worth a bit over a 13 what she went for newactually paid in 98   ,riez

210,February 2004,i read this from another forum    you just need to read the numbers to figure out what cd is about i remember the comparo between the cls and the 330i that you mention in fact you can find it online curiously the 330i seemed to jump nearly 15 seconds faster to 60 58 vs 73 than when they tested it alone it also ripped through the 14 in an astonishing 144 seconds i say astonishing because in the same issue they list it in the roadtest digest as needing a whole 156 seconds which is much more in line with every other place ive seen it tested then they didnt even question this remarkable improvement    they go on to say that the 330i beats the cls due to its performance advantage but when you look at the numbers they give the cls a better rating for the engine a better rating for the transmission and an equal rating for handling then they give the cls a 7 for styling while giving the bmw a 10  and so the cls loses by 1 point    styling is purely subjective,danny1878

221,February 2004,blue    nobody said volkswagen doesnt have quality issues they do but i dont think their product is as bad as you are making it out to be volkswagen has an older product line and they are not discounting their cars and that is why they are being taken to the cleaners by the american and japanese manufacturers i was very mazdar with volkswagenaudi products way before i owned one i hang out at volkswagenvortex a lot i chose audi because they are better made and more reliable than their volkswagen counterparts so far ive had a terrific ownership experience with my audi sorry to hear that you had a bad experience,speedracer3
222,February 2004,i said bmw rep rests on style performance and ability to attract young buyers pardon me but i dont think lexus is well known for any of those things     differnt values at each co i agree but the new gs and the new is will change that as well as the cool hybrids and chrysler470 trucks that youger blingers want style is subjective they sell em without a discount so the ugly aspect isnt there if objectively speakingand performance will change in fact those cos that put hybrid front drives with gas rear drives in the same car will outperfrom everyone    im not convinced infiniti has gotten lexus credibility just yet  they just found a young buyers niche only 2 years agothose werent young people in those qs and is that i saw over the last decademaybe g20 and then most young people went right to the nissan and saved 15k,chrisboth
223,February 2004,meanwhile the 5 series got worse and costs morethat repuation will only last so longmercedes benz found out    got worse based on what is this claimed the edmunds review bashes them at times but overall they still find the car more fun to drive than its counterparts    two of their complaints i cant get my head around idrive and lack of nav idrive is a snap to use in the 745i yes ive driven them and used it without a problem and the new version in the 5 is even more simplistic push a direction for a controloops wrong way its down for x control now you know problem solved    as for the navi thingwhatever its a fairly useless toy but then again like idrive i like to explore and discover things on my own,blueguydotcom
224,February 2004,you can read what they say at current business week which is not online yet i believe    point is generally speaking meaning not everyone agrees people in the auto media believe infiniti cars are more appealing to the crowd who find bmw appealing both have strengths in style performance and youthful appeal    now i know some lexus fans believe lexus is best at everything i dont believe for even a second,mariner7
225,February 2004,got worse based on what is this claimed the edmunds review bashes them at times but overall they still find the car more fun to drive than its counterparts    the driving experience is the same apparently  all good but the downgraded look plus the money they wantnot so sure the market will accept the 5 for that money in 3 yearsmaybe now but the last 5 may have been the holy grail and may never be reproduced in terms of success i think the editor thought it would at least drive differently and better the audi for 05 should be an interesting attempt to best the 5  well see    and navs are the worst for a car  why o why should a car with 250 bucks in hardware be worth another 2k  ill never know    point is generally speaking meaning not everyone agrees people in the auto media believe infiniti cars are more appealing to the crowd who find bmw appealing both have strengths in style performance and youthful appeal    i think the nissan corp has had this one down for a while actually recanting here and capitalizes on what honda and toyota seem to neglect  style and inexpensive performance at least with the z car and the nissan,chrisboth

232,February 2004,it sounds good as long as its a 51 cd in the player  but other than the 1 they give you at the dealer  youd be listening to regular cds which when played put the stereo on par with the g bose system  not bad but not exactly better by any margin than what everyone else offers for 200240 watts    for those of you with the upgraded bose in a g the tweeters suck and when replaced with polk exs for 50 and half hour the sound system becomes alive and the imaging is much better the effectively drops the crossover from 8k to 4k and makes for much better highs with that thumping bass in the sedan anyway    ps    i should have bought best buy stock on the ipo  those electronic gadgets get a huge markup and just the few that have to be first to get something new support the lower prices later on for me this desire transcends into car options and premiums paid for them what would people pay for the tl no blutooth or 51 less since they wont have bragging rights    tek nuts hate me  i still have windows 98 and a glass tube tv,chrisboth
233,February 2004,it is no wonder that the es330 sells so well even though not many people seem to be enthralled with its exterior styling with the impending death of the i35 and the new tls emphasis on sport it is basically the only import choice that emphasizes ride quality over handling in this price category and the general population which is statistically not well represented by the regulars here or the car magazines seems to prioritize ride quality over handling the es330s gorgeous interior doesnt hurt it either,jrock65
234,February 2004,and the general population which is statistically not well represented by the regulars here or the car magazines seems to prioritize ride quality over handling the es330s gorgeous interior doesnt hurt it either    exactly when cr placed the tl over the es in the feb issue they totally missed the mark as these two cars offer different user experiences not that people wont crosscompare or seriously wont crossshop them but  i cant imagine any person getting into an es330 and thinking they are getting a sports sedan like ride nor can i imagine anyone getting into a tl thinking they are going to have a boatlike isolated ride    the tl is not better than the es it is different both are high ranked above their common name baseline counterparts but the es doesnt even offer a sporty like ride,kdshapiro

242,March 2004,1 the interior is a complete do over expect to see seat controls changed higher quality leathers and an upgraded dash possibly lcd instruments since that is what is coming in the new bmw5m45 i also expect we will see aluminum pedals added and the nissaninum painted center or any painted trim to disappear this makeover of the interior is a 100 redo    2 the sheet metal will not change but the front and rear bumpers will be totally redone and incorporate the aero kits or something very similar to them on both the coupe and sedan models for those of you with 03 model sedans that have been wanting to buy an aero kit infiniti has just reduced the price 23 they are closing them out because next year they will be standard    3 dont look for a horsepower increase because there wont be one but you can certainly look for a price increase,jrock65

244,March 2004,the rumor is the updated g will be at the ny auto show next month along with the new bmw545the g available in the fall,cheerioboy26
245,March 2004,its good to hear the upgrades however nissaninfiniti should learn from this and apply to all future new products that cutting corners to save a penny here will cut sales and hurt image possibly do it right from the onset and reap the rewards as in the new acura tl,prattster
246,March 2004,perhaps acura should learn from infiniti and make a sports sedan that is based on a sports car rather than front drive family car they all look to and learn from each other    perhaps they did us a service those infiniti guys and instead of spending more money on the g concept and making it pricier they figured out that what matters is not the interior its perfect balance and a rigid rwd platform get that right first and then improve the fluff stuff,chrisboth
247,March 2004,also didnt notice infiniti suffering from any reputation probs,chrisboth
248,March 2004,fyi acura tl sedan sales for  jan 2004 5036 units es330 5254 units  feb 2004 6274 units es330  units  acura tl sales up by 1238 units compared to jan sales and over lexus in jan    pontiac5 sedan sales for  jan 2004 3382 units  feb 2004 3439 units only up 57 units    feb2004 for pontiac5 coupe is 2145 units  tl sedan sales is more than pontiac5 sedan and coupe combines lol good reputation heh    lucky acura didnt learn from people who know so much about sports 47 up in jan 57 in feb,danny1878
249,March 2004,thats right after two years on the market the pontiac5 sedan is still selling at the same rate it was from the beginning its also a more accurate comparison to compare sales in the same month of the preceeding year since there is an annual ebb and flow to car sales in general winter is not exactly the best time to sell a sports coupe or a convertible for example    pontiac5 sedan sales up 42 from feb 2003 sales of 2410 that comparison is more meaningful    im sure the tl did much better this month when compared to its sales in feb 2003 but you also have to consider it is an outgoing model vs a brand new model comparision    after two years in the market with all of the complaints about the lack of a manual in its first year plus ongoing criticisms of the interior some valid some not whether or not the styling will remain fresh the g continues to sell,cheerioboy26
250,March 2004,agreed they should do that from day one perhaps now that they have money they will these cars that get this criticism most pontiac5 nissan were designed at the bottom of nissan problems right when ghosn came aboard,cheerioboy26
251,March 2004,4092 units is the best pontiac5 sedan could do in 2003 augustsummer particularly is the trend going up or down cheerioboy,danny1878
252,March 2004,the tls sales no doubt speak for itself in terms of the popularity of the car    but if im a tl owner i wouldnt necessarily be happy with this since this means that there are tls all over the place    it seems the nissan increased in sales by a bit 5200 for many nissan buyers the nissan is a viable alternative to the pontiac5 if one is willing to sacrifices some sport for room and fwd for snow and is not willing to pay extra for awd a fully loaded nissan and a pontiac5 offer similar features for almost the same price    bmw sold 2492 325i and 467 330i this isnt surprising since the 3 is near the end of its model run sales will pick up when the next 3 is introduced but bmw will have to do an excellent job the tl has been a big success the pontiac5 will only get better with the redone interior and lexus seems serious about the next is 3series domination is no longer a gimme in this segment as it once used to be    merc1    he didnt say when the 05 pontiac5 would be released but since the 04 pontiac5 and pontiac5 coupe were released in august 2003 i would guess that the 05 would be released around the same time in 2004,jrock65
253,March 2004,the maxy should be compared to the tl imo looks like nissan wins that comp the g is comparable to nothing in the acurahonda lineup only for price sake do we get into the comparison game with g and tl,chrisboth
254,March 2004,youre right jrock65 but if i want exclusiveness i wouldnt have bought a 3040k car which can be afforded by most people what makes them not buying them is a question of need and quality    the only thing that can stop people from buying car are limited edition car expensiveness or less quality    comparing nissan to tl that is the only thing that you got nissan is a failure in nissan lol no offense but is the truth gtg,danny1878
255,March 2004,if sales are the metric by which you judge success  the maxy rules    all subjectivity about looks aside  whats wrong with it other than oversteer problems its fast big and while not as nimble  its a fwd sporty sedan just like the acura    the fact that they compare the acura to the g actually says quite a bit for the tl i will concede i wouldnt go too far with it tho as the platforms are very different even if the tl drivers cant tell    i stirred it up good this time ma,chrisboth
256,March 2004,the trend is neither up nor down in my opinion in the long term picking out one month out of the air doesnt make or break a car but comparing janfeb 04 to janfeb 03 does have value you cant compare the summer number to the current number you wont find the manufacturers using that comparison either im not going to get into a sales argument we all know the tl outsells the pontiac5 everyone has their reasons why they pick one over the other    valuable discussions regarding sales within a model line would probably be either yeartoyear monthly comparisons or cumulative comparisons  for example fallwinter 200303 to fallwinter 200304 or total yearly sales,cheerioboy26
257,March 2004,tl sedan sales is more than pontiac5 sedan and coupe combines lol good reputation heh    lucky acura didnt learn from people who know so much about sports 47 up in jan 57 in feb      thats an interesting thing youre basically saying the infiniti which hasnt enjoyed good sales over the past 10 years isnt doing well by moving 5060k units of the g most struggling manufacturers would love to offload 3040k cars in those kind of numbers    id say both cars are a hit fair enough    im just itching for an awd tl 6 speed by may 2006 i couldnt stomach a wrong wheel drive car so maybe acura will meet enthusiasts half way with awd and give us a reason to defect ideally let us split the power with a cpu ala the subaru sti85 rear 15 frontoh yummy,blueguydotcom
258,March 2004,looks real likely this will be built 300 hp but doesnt say whether awd is certain    httpwwwimakenewscomautospiesearticle000214337cfm,bobcatman
259,March 2004,with improved interior materials i might very well have chosen the pontiac5 instead of the acura last summer    i dont think that the interior layoutstyling wchange will be too ddodgeatic though because the pontiac5 has to remain on the nissan family treethat polarizing funky french tree,fedlawman
260,March 2004,have you seen the interiors on the fx and nissan nissan can do a nice job they just tend to cheap out    how do you like your acura sometimes i wish id bought it over my zhp,blueguydotcom
261,March 2004,what dont you like about your zhp,kahunah
262,March 2004,if sales are the metric by which you judge success  the maxy rules     i dunno bout you but experts in cd motorweek cr did compare tl with 330i325i and pontiac5 chris maybe you are more of an expert sort of whos right then whereis maxy  in fact in edmund 20022003 comparison pontiac5 couldnt outsell the previous 32 tl and considered a tieif not second after bmw how can a pontiac5 win over the new tl how absurd    pontiac5 is not as fast as tl  pontiac5 is not as well equipped like tl  pontiac5 is cheaper than tl  pontiac5 is not as luxy as tl  pontiac5 does sell less than tl  pontiac5 is not as high tech as tl  what else is wrong with this car to me is a lot and so to other 6 thousand people who chosed tl lol thats is why only 3 thousands people choose pontiac5 isnt that sad for a so called bettersportier car than tl and its cheaper too lol why dont they buy    blueguy cheerioboy i respect your opinions    i like stirring the pot lol tee hee ,danny1878
263,March 2004,pontiac5 is not as fast as tl    disagree the cd comparo found the tl to be faster 0 to 60 but the average of the entire sample of tests seems to say that the two cars are a dead heat 0 to 60 and the pontiac5 is slightly faster in the 14 mile    pontiac5 is not as well equipped like tl    depends the g has some features that the tl lacks and vice nissan personally i prefer the exclusive features of the g since bluetooth dvdaudio and voice operation navi isnt worth it is useless to me    pontiac5 is cheaper than tl    the base g is cheaper than the tl but very very few people get the base g similarly configured the pontiac5 costs a bit more but i would think that this is a plus for the tl not a minus    pontiac5 is not as luxy as tl    if by luxy you mean better interior then yes    pontiac5 does sell less than tl    no doubt about it    pontiac5 is not as high tech as tl    yes the tl has more high tech features    again i really like the tl and would personally get it over the pontiac5 depending on how good the 2005 pontiac5 interior changes are i just dont think that either is better than the other in any quantitative sense of the word,jrock65
264,March 2004,fair enough jrock i respect your opinion,danny1878
265,March 2004,wow no issues with one of your postslol correct id most likely have a pontiac5 coupe now if it werent for these rumors about its interior being redone and because of the interior not being up to the rest of the car in the first place id be sick if i bought one now and they redo the interior 56 months from now    jrock65    i hope august is correct sure would be nice    m,merc1
266,March 2004,the tl vs pontiac5 debatemy take    both of these cars are great naturally you have to open with that line    the tl looks better imo has a better interior is a hair faster is fwd  depending and has more features    the pontiac5 handles better stops better and is rwd  depending    i think its really pointless to argue reliability here neither will match that other japanese luxury brand per the surveys they are both competing for 2nd place here    price is pretty much a nonissue too at least around here    i think it comes down to whether you want more luxuryfeatures or more performance straightline speed isnt everything and rwd handling characteristics    neither one of these cars clobbers the other overall    m,merc1
267,March 2004,merc1 im cool with your opinion lol i think i know what is the other japanese luxury brand i like it especially the ls430,danny1878
268,March 2004,not really near luxury but performance sedan in every sense of the term    httpwwwrsportscarscomengcarsbmwconceptbmwasp    500 hp    i think itll be a tad faster than the tl or pontiac5,jrock65
269,March 2004,i think itll be a tad faster than the tl or pontiac5    who cares its still ugly,kahunah
270,March 2004,i knew this was going to happen a 500hp v10 a 7speed smg transmission the e55 rs6 stype r xjr s55 and other so called highend sport sedans have all been surpassed    styling aside which im starting to like this new bmw is going to inhale the cars in its segment in dynamics and performance    m,merc1
271,March 2004,just remember that is only one source interestingly enough cd got very close to those motortrend aspec numbers with their stock tl so interpret that how you will im willing to bet that motortrends stock numbers are a bit conservative and make that aspec package look way better than it is in real life a 06 improvement in skidpad is pretty incredible a 02 cds stock number vs motortrends aspec number seems much more realistic to me  17 ford crew 27 67 coronet rt 14 towncountry limited 09 lsubaru hse 44car history and counting,qbrozen
272,March 2004,im going to prove someone paid 45k for a v get real    i can see how it could be done gm card various other certificates that are available if you can find a dealer that will accept them looks like the guy that paid 45k may have done just that    i also dont think autoweek makes up msrps the aspec is overpriced at the price point where autoweek tested it,eaton53
273,March 2004,i would expect much better numbers as the acura and the acura are capable of those numbers hell the old acura could skidpad 77 imagine 2651845s on a g 9 skidpad would become 9598 or even 10 thats just tires put a 5100 package on the g coupe and run with the 911 put it on the g sedan and run with m class,chrisboth
274,March 2004,now question does anyone have published numbers for a nonzhp 330 vs a zhp 330 and the total price difference    3900thats the price difference bmw claimed the zhp dropped the zero to 60 numbers to 59 tests by mags get it lower v the official 65 of the 330i check bmwusacom for that ill have to do some digging for the numbers i know the slalom numbers were different too,blueguydotcom
275,March 2004,put a 5100 package on the g coupe and run with the 911 put it on the g sedan and run with m class    that is a pipe dream youd better find another 100 or so hp for a g to run with any of the really serious factory sports sedans,eaton53
276,March 2004,i think a g could run with an bmw without the extra hundred hphow about 50 point is spending 5100 bucks is doing little for the aspec tl to get it up to mid lux sedan expectations,chrisboth
277,March 2004,so the 3900 zhp package includes the engine mods    of course you need those engine mods just to compete in straight lines with the stock tl but do those necessarily come with the improved suspension or can you get the suspension upgrades without the engine mods  17 ford crew 27 67 coronet rt 14 towncountry limited 09 lsubaru hse 44car history and counting,qbrozen
278,March 2004,exactly my point we cant prove what that guy paid so the ctsv is 50k for points of this discussion and the aspec tl as far as we know is about 40k without navigation so thats 10k more for the ctsv  17 ford crew 27 67 coronet rt 14 towncountry limited 09 lsubaru hse 44car history and counting,qbrozen
279,March 2004,read up on cds numbers  hell go back and read this discussion youll find several people have shown several times over that the stock tl numbers compare very favorably with the other cars we talk about here and it doesnt need the aspec package to do so  17 ford crew 27 67 coronet rt 14 towncountry limited 09 lsubaru hse 44car history and counting,qbrozen
280,March 2004,hondaing to a car and driver article ive readit seems that nismo nissan motorsports arm products might not offered for infiniti vehicles because of fears of tarnishing the luxury persona of the brand on the other hand nismo products will be avaible for popular nissan cars like the 350z it is a shame since the nismo tuned jdm skylines pontiac5 are hellish machines hopefully nissan will see the light and allow car enthusiasts to purchase performance parts for their infinitis,speedracer3
281,March 2004,how do you italicize quoted sections of other posts    thanks,jrock65
282,March 2004,so the 3900 zhp package includes the engine mods    everything i listed from exteriorinterior mods to engine modifications to suspension changes all come with a zhp package    but do those necessarily come with the improved suspension or can you get the suspension upgrades without the engine mods    its all one package the only optional items from the package are the trunk lip spoiler and getting leather over that stupid alcantara garbage,blueguydotcom
283,March 2004,it is a shame since the nismo tuned jdm skylines pontiac5 are hellish machines hopefully nissan will see the light and allow car enthusiasts to purchase performance parts for their infinitis     if the 350z and the g are essentially the same except body panels  why wouldnt one be allowed to upgrade thier g with those nismos components just because the infiniti dealer wont be offering them doesnt mean they arent available in fact most of my work and parts supply come from nissan anyway    if theres one thing the g has got its z and g enthusiasts galore and many many aftermarket suppliers of performance parts and it stems from the 350z guys who are nuts about performance nismo is only offering what is available elsewhere from other sometimes better suppliers,chrisboth
284,March 2004,ok thanks for the info    considering all that seems like the performance package is a bargain when considered by itself and compared against other similar upgrades the jcw mini comes to mind  17 ford crew 27 67 coronet rt 14 towncountry limited 09 lsubaru hse 44car history and counting,qbrozen
285,March 2004,type  i  without the spaces to start the italics and then   i  again no spaces at all to end them you can do the same thing with b instead of i for bold instead of italics and they can be used together if you want there are many html guides all over the web that any search engine will find for you if you want to go further,pat
286,March 2004,its its not a matter of being allowed nismo makes performance packages tailored for specific cars like the 350z not to say you cant take a part from a nissan kit and use it on an infinitiwhat you wont be able to do is buy a nismo kit for say a pontiac5 coupe although this package is available in japan you cant get it here again nissan feels that nismo takes away from the infiniti image i think its silly and i hope nissan reconsiders,speedracer3
287,March 2004,the rather high cost of the zhp aspec and ltuned are just another factor in the value equation none of them are really worth it they just dont give you that much for the money much of the aspec and ltuned were for nonperformance things like exterior changes    guess that is why i bought an lexus manual could get a reliable fun car for about 30000 and it had hid and lsd    heck id rather have a 30000 325i sport 5speed manual than a 40000 330i zhp then id use the 10000 to buy myself a muscle car say amc amx or javelin,riez
288,March 2004,i agree with riez on that why we should buy a performance package for a sedan    if you are really into performance go with the two seater its better than buying performance package which doesnt perform 060 59 the aspec which is mainly only stability  body makeup sedan always have the luxury part with too much performance nobody cant even see it its too fast,danny1878
289,March 2004,the rather high cost of the zhp aspec and ltuned are just another factor in the value equation none of them are really worth it    guess its all a matter of priorities i know for a fact i could get the engine interiorexterior suspension and tire mods for 4k its impossible just the differential swap would be a hassle new cams headers ecu and exhaust    heck id rather have a 30000 325i sport 5speed manual than a 40000 330i zhp    different worlds thats like comparing a cts to a ctsv or a ford v6 to an svt yes its a two second difference and the entire character of the car is different,blueguydotcom
290,March 2004,my biggest concern with the packages is that that 5k you add up front will pretty much be worth nothing when you go to sell the car sure some here or there will know what it means and want to pay more but most likely you will eat that cost    either way would love to have the package but the cost is pretty high,95gt
291,March 2004,do it yourself and dont pay someone to make mods to your car or do them one at time    maybe some will want the body packages and the aspec buyers will be there for those who just want a newer looking or cooler looking car all the performance stuff anyone can do anywhere without much help the funnest thing of owning a g has been minor tweaks and little money that create small incrimental gains that i can notice and tweak do one and then do another down the road while appreciating each tweak on its own is my philosophy i would suggest most of us would rather buy the car without a perf pack and make the mods ourselves the zhp is an exception as it offers some big changes to a luxo car to get it to be alot differet    for 200 bucks i added 1014 hp with an intake for another 120 i added no real gains with my hyper grounding kit but added much smoothness and better responsiveness while eliminating the gurgle the intake created for another 450 i bought a crawford z car intake plenum which adds 20hp so for less than 1k i got about 2025 hp at peak increased the sound quality of the motor get better gas mileage 45 mpg have a smoother idle and start up and i dont have the hp drop at 6000    if they offered a 6000 nismo package i say no do the perf mods myself and save 5000 on body kit bolt ons that will never work out as well as if bolted on at the plant in the first place    now i belive i am running z power at the crank anyway  weight diff is about 150 anyone see the z in the lastest cd they got a 138 14 running stock at 102 or so everytime they test the fm seems faster and faster break in alone is good for 20hp id bet with the vq,chrisboth
292,March 2004,i am of two minds on this one in most cases i would be inclined to buy the base car and then tweak it myself most likely after the manufacturers warranty expired that said between the 325i and the 330i and again between the 330i and the 330i zhp one would be hard pressed to match the full package of the more expensive car for the same money to say nothing of having a factory warranty on the extra goodies so in the case of the 3series id be more inclined to go with the factory upgrade    best regards  shipo,shipo
293,March 2004,another funny thing about the 330i to zhp switch its really a crazy number of mods for only 2800 if one were to buy a 330i and get the sports package 1200,blueguydotcom
294,March 2004,well apparently the zhp package is popular enough that theyre putting it on the coupe and convertible as well    im not sure why infiniti is nixing nismo especially since theyre going for the japanese bmw image everything rwd or awd handling a priority etc    most boy racer kids wont be able to afford it anyway,jrock65
295,March 2004,okay fair enough i hadnt considered that the difference between the 330i sp and the 330i zhp was considerably less than just the cost of the zhp as such i went through and configured the three as i would have ordered them    325i 5speed metallic paint leather pp sp harmon kardon 36595  330i 6speed metallic paint pp sp xenon 41570  330i 6speed metallic paint zhp leather moon roof xenon 43470    so in the as i would buy it configuration the 330i comes at a 4975 premium fairly substantial however imho the considerable power gain coupled with the 6speed transmission bigger brakes and bigger wheels and tires easily justify the price    then there is the 330i to 330i zhp difference of only 1900 a nobrainer on a car listing at over 40k    best regards  shipo,shipo
296,March 2004,heres the quote from the april 2004 cd    things are getting complicated at nismo nissan motorsports and tuning arm so far the us distributor has been shipped more than 700 sets of high performance suspension wheel and exhaust packages for the 350z and ideally the company would like to send the same sport goodies for the infiniti pontiac5 coupe known as the nissan skyline coupe in japanbecause hey this nismo skyline developed together with sonys gran turismo people looks pretty damn good the problem is that in the us the car is an infiniti not a nissan as it is in japan and the us marketing types feel that nismo parts might not suit the upscale brand image,speedracer3
297,March 2004,shipo your numbers point out the lack of value at the high end of the 3 series youre looking at 41600 and 43500 for 330i that is just way too expensive with gm car rebates financing deals credit card rebates etc that ctsv might be less out of pocket than your zhp think id rather have an 530i sport manual with limited options or a cpo 540i6,riez
298,March 2004,just looked over the consumer reports 2004 annual auto issue lexus still a great deal great value a ton of car for the money fantastic reliabilitypast present and future outstanding safety assessment great car new or used    3 series still lags in reliability pontiac5 better but not quite there tl too new to tell,riez
299,March 2004,that is just way too expensive with gm car rebates financing deals credit card rebates etc that ctsv might be less out of pocket than your zhp think id rather have an 530i sport manual with limited options or a cpo 540i6    a cts  caddy  id rather be dead than own a gm seriously they could offer a 600 hp engine in the best handling chassis ever and i will not own it or a ford    b 530i 6 speed  big and a sticker with sports package and xenon of 49k thatd be 49k for a slower less responsive larger car    c 545i 6 speed  is it even out yet  59k without any options    59k or 39khmm thats an easy call yes my car had a 43k msrp lets assume you can get 4k off a 545i so itd still be 55k 16k difference,blueguydotcom
300,March 2004,i dont know what you have against gm but the ctsv is just the best car in its class period,exalteddragon1
301,March 2004,imo i dont care who or which country that make the car as long as it meets my requirement then its fine    why people keep comparing a 57 litre engine with 30 litre engine 50k vs 3040k what about the 36 ctsv which is more makes sense    there is always something that we dont like either its about the look reliability performance luxury etc for 50k i would go with lexusbmw and maybe the future model of rl need to see it first thou its a blunt attempt to make a car with performance only without considering other aspects,danny1878
302,March 2004,however when you say i want an american car companyford or whomever  to go out of business the line between car discusion passion and financial political discussion gets crossed    as a passionate car lover im speaking from a purely emotional level i feel the same way about steven spielberg microsoft mcdonalds and a host of other franchisescompanies that represent qualities i dislike    of course on a business school bottomline side i totaly understand the economic dodgeifications created by voiding any of these moneymakers the ardent capitalist side screams make money any way you can sell them a box of rocks fro 1000 and call it mars diamonds    the cold business school trained analytical side tends to scare more people than the emotional side if i could stamp out substandard products at half the cost of my competitors and lure more people into buying my products for multi billion dollar profits i would    back to our regularly scheduled progdodge squabbling about the performance of a 50k entry level luxury sedan,blueguydotcom

306,March 2004,regarding near luxury performance sedans    as a point of reference i drive a 2002 530i 5speed with enough extra goodies to have brought the msrp up to nearly 49000 that said i got a good deal and did the european delivery thing which resulted in a final price of just south of 43000 that of course does not count the cost of the european trip but i would have taken it anyway and rented a car while i was there    from my point of view my car completely meets my needs wants and desires its fun to drive economical 31 mpg on the highway reliable two years old and no unscheduled trips to the dealership good looking inside and out luxurious certainly fast enough to get my attention and capable enough to deal with its power and ability to go fast what do i mean by that last bit on the autobahn during my ed trip i was tooling along at the speed limiter 1285 mph when a motorcycle pulled out directly in front of me doing something like 60 mph i performed an emergency lane change unfortunately when he saw me in the mirror he did the same keeping him directly in my sights and then performed what could best be described as an anchor dropping test of the brakes at our closest we only got within two feet of each other him under full acceleration and me in panic stop mode so he still had a little margin for his error and as such he lived for another day hopefully    having said all of that i have been reading here that there are certain cars of a similar price and size with bigger if not substantially bigger motors that are superior vehicles for the money uhhuh right i suppose anybody can throw a big engine in any given car and proclaim it superior to other similar cars with smaller engines and i suppose to their way of thinking it is to my way of thinking thats the easy part and that its the rest of the package that makes the upgraded car truly superior would a ctsv for instance have acquitted itself as perfectly as my 530i did in the above situation unknown but i suspect that the ctsv is likely to have a much greater front end weight bias and as such would not have been able to perform the lane change and the deceleration without hitting the individual on the bike after his ill advised maneuver    balance thats what the bmw offers and yes on paper it will certainly cost more for what you seem to get so if i had it to do all over again and if i was faced with the choice of a ctsv or my 530i for about the same price what would i choose probably the bmw call me naïve call me dumb call me wasteful call me a poseur call me whatever you like i can live with that     best regards  shipo,shipo

313,March 2004,shipo im glad you like your car and feel safe in it but its extra mass means that it has worse skidpad numbers and longer braking than many of the cars in the title of this discussion so i would certainly not say that they cannot handle the situation as well or better  17 ford crew 27 67 coronet rt 14 towncountry limited 09 lsubaru hse 44car history and counting,qbrozen
314,March 2004,yeah id take a 28000 g in that situation over any non m bmw and id take a bmw over 998 of all other makes and models out there i think the numbers and actual dynamics of both cars are good but there is a consistently better performance margin from the g which would indicate ease of manuevering in same situation and weve beat the brakes thing to death the bmw is more forgiving and not as sport as the barely entry lux g doubt there much to disagree with other than preference there both cars on the autobahn are better than any caddy  so farshipo hit it on the head pretty well with the stuffing a big motor in it doesnt make it betteri was dissapointed in what ive discovered about the ctsv and would hope a 300hp 6 and a better interor was in the making,chrisboth
315,March 2004,extra mass compared to what not trying to pick a fight however the manual transmission version of the 530i weighs in at only 96 pounds more than a three pedal pontiac5 sedan thats not even a tank of gas that said the sp on my 530i includes 235 section width tires as opposed to the 215 tires that come on the pontiac5 my guess is that the extra inch of tire width will at least offset the whopping 96 pound weight difference call it a draw    regarding my comment about another car acquitting itself as well as my car did in the situation i found myself in you will notice that i was referring a presumably nose heavy ctsv and not the pontiac5 i consider the g a reasonably well balanced car with very acceptable driving characteristics to my eye however its styling inside and out just doesnt pass muster which i understand is simply personal preference    best regards  shipo,shipo
316,March 2004,ctsv is 5446 hondaing to road and track thats not nose heavy    since you are commenting quite a bit about your 5 series and weight consider this comment by cd mar 2004 in regards to the bmw vs ctsv    cadillacs steering was gratifyingly precise it turned in like marshall faulk cutting for the goal line and if its weight transfer wasnt quite as smoothly managed as the bmw there wasnt a hint of reluctance in its transient responses the ctsv was also perfectly happy to provide the driver with as much oversteer as he wanted the breakaway might be a little more abrupt but once rotation set in it was easy enough to control with a judicious throttle foot    as we all know the ctsv edged out the bmw in lap times despite the driver admittingly shortshifting due to a faulty oil pressure sensor on the ctsv in his best estimate he would have beaten the bmw as well if pushing the caddy at 100    brian,bxd20
317,March 2004,hmmm 5446 sounds nose heavy to me maybe not fwd nose heavy but front biased nonetheless especially when compared to the 501499 of the 530i    regarding the e39 bmw that was so gracefully retired still at the top of the heap last year i suppose that cadillac should in all fairness be able to crow about being king of the hill for a while that is like everything else out there the competition does not stand still the odds on bet is that the ctsv will once again be considered an alsoran in a years time or so just like the cts has been since it was launched    best regards  shipo,shipo
318,March 2004,the tl is nose heavy but still stops faster than the 530 and is neck and neck with last gens sport package 530 on the skidpad the 2004 is a big improvement however    i do stand corrected on the mass however i thought it was much heavier than it really is    as far as the ctsv being an alsoran i think it will still be held up as the most bang for the buck regardless its the same reason the z06 does so well in comparisons with much more expensive cars its not that its the best but its good enough that the reviewers would opt for it and save a bundle of money over similar vehicles  17 ford crew 27 67 coronet rt 14 towncountry limited 09 lsubaru hse 44car history and counting,qbrozen
319,March 2004,cadillacs steering was gratifyingly precise it turned in like marshall faulk cutting for the goal line and if its weight transfer wasnt quite as smoothly managed as the bmw there wasnt a hint of reluctance in its transient responses    uh marshall faulk hasnt cut smoothly in a couple years hes basically emmitt smith jr out there now,blueguydotcom
320,March 2004,i am glad you avoided an accident and you are ok but to say that your bmw 530 could do something and another car could not do it is simply ridiculus unless you have tried the same manuevuer with another car you are taking a huge leap of faith,speedracer3
321,March 2004,ummm maybe i missed it where exactly did i say that my 530i would do anything better than anything else    if i remember correctly i said i suspect yes no    best regards  shipo,shipo
322,March 2004,come on shipo you are implying that the cts could never pull that maneuver because of what you infer about its weight distribution lets not kid,speedracer3
323,March 2004,the ongoing connissantions but i am just letting you all know that yesterday i gave a bmw a spanking it would never forget  the guy initiated the call and all he was looking at during the race was my tls doulble pipes    one up for us fwd,billyperks
324,March 2004,given that the ctsv and the 530i are within seven pounds of each other with similar sized brakes and tires and assuming that both cars have an abs system that keeps the rubber on the ragged edge of lockup and that both cars have the brake assist feature im not sure about the ctsv my guess is that it would be a very close contest to see which car would slow down from 128 to about 70 the quickest    all else being equal which of course it never is the car with the better weight distribution should handle the maneuver better than the one with the front end weight bias would the ctsv have acquitted itself as well maybe maybe not    best regards  shipo,shipo
325,March 2004,oooo  a tl beat the 200 hp machine of a 528 when you can pull on the 540i then you might impress someone,chrisboth
326,March 2004,thats assuming this guy with his 528 was actually looking to race too seems many people think youre looking for trouble when youre just out and about    i get people all the time spinning their engines and glancing at my at stoplights the light changes and then they take off have fun bud i like to play with my car but in sd racing or giving the appearance of racing is a sure ticket no thanks    that said once in awhile im at the front of a light i know the two lanes become one quickly and somebody pulls up beside me doing the creep thing as they await the light change we all know he wants to shoot out and take the lead    when im feeling nice i let it slide feistyi like to let him accelerate and i keep pace for a bit as his engine screams  seems suv drivers do this the most often as we build speed i finally just wave and punch it bubye    silly people    i just know one of these days a kid with a turbocharged protege will smack me in the face as he scampers away faster,blueguydotcom
327,March 2004,depending on the year the e39 bmw had either 190 or 193 hp regardless of which one was the subject of the above abject humiliation billyperks you da man now    best regards  shipo,shipo
328,March 2004,the tl is nose heavy but still stops faster than the 530 and is neck and neck with last gens sport package 530 on the skidpad the 2004 is a big improvement however    the tl has turned in some extremely disappointing stops from 700 was it the rt article that listed 188 feet the 530 certainly stops faster than that from 70 to 0 so i dont see how it stops faster than the 530,kdshapiro

330,March 2004,i see good numbers on the tl in once place and see them very inconsistent everywhere else the car does seem to give every tester a sub 6 060 so ill give the car props for that just be careful when stomping it from a stoppeople in other forums are saying if youre next to a tl and it launches it will veer right and one guy almost got slammed i now stay to the left of tls when appoaching lights  they are everywhere now and a racy bunch too,chrisboth
331,March 2004,im sorry but the honda is still a honda so the price is not relevant it cant be a luxury car by virtue of its origins its not near to or close to being a luxury car    when i read near or entrylevel lux i think of cars that are scraping the bottom of the luxury barrel  the 3 series the c class lexus lexus type x these are cars from luxury brands that are used to suck in buyers get them into the luxury fold with low prices and attempt to move them upmarket when they trade out in 35 years    its a luxury brand selling first the brand and then the amenities  some upmarket bits  but for the most part its about getting buyers to associate good things with a brand they want buyers to identify with the brand and hope the buyers are looking to graduate up    the honda is at the top of the honda food chain it tops out there so it cant possibly entrylevel lux  there is no upsell at the end of the honda tenure    bmw jag mb will all atest to their desire to use their low end entry lux cars as a springboard,blueguydotcom
332,March 2004,relax blueguydotcom im not pushing for the honda to be included here i just used it as an example of a car that might be defined as close yet not in any category that includes the word luxury    and i was puzzling about my own issues with the term near luxury because to me the definition of that term has to be not luxury by virture of the word near which means close but not there its entirely possible that im being way too literal here    i think the cars you name are certainly some that this discussion could best serve i understand your point but scraping the bottom of the barrel is an image that is a little overly harsh regarding the very fine vehicles on your list    read the first post here  it actually lays out the padodgeeters pretty nicely    other thoughts,pat
333,March 2004,i dont agree with blueguys reasoning that a car cannot be considered a luxury car because the brand is not a luxury marque    for example i would argue that the phaeton is certainly a luxury car although volkswagen is not considered a luxury brand    its really tough to say what is a near luxury perfomance sedan my thinking is that cars like a loaded nissan and subaru should belong in this group,jrock65
334,March 2004,performance sedans    and all of the issues prices and comparisons among any of these cars should be discussed    too many hangups with luxury,designman
335,March 2004,pat wrote  and i was puzzling about my own issues with the term near luxury because to me the definition of that term has to be not luxury by virture of the word near which means close but not there its entirely possible that im being way too literal here    were in the same field i think i tend to view nearentry lux as a vehicle that doesnt have the full boat of brand cache a 3 series while fun still suffers in many eyes from the fact its a compact sedan you own a c or a 3 and its usually not a big deal an e class or a 5 series thats a car of breeding  all perception but thats what were talking about here    i think the cars you name are certainly some that this discussion could best serve i understand your point but scraping the bottom of the barrel is an image that is a little overly harsh regarding the very fine vehicles on your list    the average mom and pop car may even cost as much as the c is es etc but those hondatoyota dont offer the visceral pop and the brand of the similarily priced possibly higher performing counterparts    remember the c and 3 like the ml and x are there to get people into the brand lexus is was released with one goal lower the average age of lexus buyers they want to hook them into the brand at 20 so at 35 the ls is a reasonable jump    jrock you mentioned the phaeton the sales of the phaeton 304 in the usa for january and february combined would lead one to conclude the general buying public doesnt accept the idea of a luxury volkswagen its the company that makes the bug and still does to this day a 17k bug parked next to a 50k phaeton talk about a blunder by volkswagen,blueguydotcom
336,March 2004,the very impressive phaeton has broken new ground and represents outofthebox thinking on the part of volkswagen given enough time and further refinements performancehandling wise the phaeton will definitely give the mb s series and bmw 7 series a run for their money    i give volkswagen alot of credit for making this bold move all it takes is a little reeducation of the luxury buying public next thing you know you take what used to be known as an economy brand in a totally new directionperformanceluxury only problem is where does that leave audi,kahunah
337,March 2004,wrong board that gm rhetoric leathersunroofhp per  wont get any traction here    m,merc1
338,March 2004,tough can of worms    i thought at first entrylevel lux might be the ticket to answering the question but then there are still some problems with that for instance the acura acura is technically acuras entry level sedan not the tl the volvo s40 would be the entry not the volvo and the 1series bimmers would be in the same boat when and if they arrive yet we cant logically step up to the audi and eclass just because we include the 2nd tier from the other brands so where does that leave us    we could limit it to certain manufacturers but i fear this also presents a problem i think subaru for instance may compete very well with the new subaru if they chose to load it up with goodies is it fair to exclude them just because they cant afford to start up a whole new rebadged brand to accomodate their vehicles with luxo ammenities    maybe its a more complex answer like if the brand has an upscale counterpart then the base brand is excluded so audi but no volkswagen acura but no honda infinity but no nissan etc however if said brand has no upscale counterpart ie subaru saab mb bmw volvo etc then it can be considered on its own merits of course that still leaves us with the problem of someone complaining the sti should be included although it doesnt even offer a stereo so we still need to figure what is required at a minimum to make it a car with luxo aspirations maybe available navigation and power leather seats can anyone think of something that falls outside those requirements that would be included or excluded here unfairly  17 ford crew 27 67 coronet rt 14 towncountry limited 09 lsubaru hse 44car history and counting,qbrozen
339,March 2004,i think it is a huge mistake by volkswagen to try going upmarket if volkswagen would just concentrate on building the audi brand they would be there no doubt the phaeton is a luxury vehicle comparable to the audi but frankly it is wearing the wrong monicker,speedracer3
340,March 2004,but why the tl and not the acura and why the volvo and not the s40    whereas i agree with you regarding some of these brands that do have existing upscale brands but come out with a luxurious car under the lower brand but im afraid opening the doors to lower brand names that have an upscale counterpart will then open comparisons of the loaded honda to the tl or acura and the loaded nissan to the pontiac5 where would that lead us  17 ford crew 27 67 coronet rt 14 towncountry limited 09 lsubaru hse 44car history and counting,qbrozen
341,March 2004,volkswagens phaeton is a luxury car for people who prefer to wear their designer labels on the inside of their clothing    if you can afford a handbuilt luxury car but dont need to go around with a threepointed star or a leaping cat or a flying lady hood ornament to proclaim your arrival then you may find that this new 64600 volkswagen more than meets your needs    we use the word more because the phaeton offers a luxury car with a 12cylinder engine for about the price of a v8powered mercedes benzmercedes benz sclass phaeton comes standard with features such as a navigation system for about what youd pay for a basic shortwheelbase 7 series bmw    volkswagen is moving upscale and the phaeton is its new luxury sedan the flagship of a fleet that in the north american market includes the volkswagen new volkswagen volkswagen eurovan volkswagen and the new touareg sportutility in 2006 we should see a modern interpretation of the hippies favorite the volkswagen microbus followed perhaps by a new midengine twoseat sports car the expansion of the volkswagen brand is part of an effort to widen the scope of the entire volkswagen group an automotive empire that includes volkswagen audi seat skoda lamborghini bugatti and bentley in 1999 the volkswagen group ranked sixth in worldwide sales but subsequently has overtaken renaultnissan and daimlerchrysler and trails only general motors ford and toyota    the term phaeton dates back to days of horsedrawn carriages and then was applied for special coachbuilt touring cars with custom features in the case of the volkswagen phaeton most of those custom features are included as standard equipment  larry edsall automotivecom,kahunah
342,March 2004,i remember a few years back when i first remember hearing this term nearluxury car at the time most of them were rebadged toyota lexus nissan hyundai etc thus many people considered them to basically be fancier toyota et al with higher stickers these cars didnt differ much from their platformmates and were lacking many of the luxury features of the true luxury cars    it seems to me like the term may be a bit more problematic now yes the es330 is still built on the toyota platform and the i35 is still based on the nissan however they look a lot different than the base cars now and have quite a few more luxury features than before    in addition the lowerend luxury models are now featuring extremely nice interiors many luxury features etc even though my 04 tl is considered nearluxury the interior still feels every bit as nice to me as my old 93 bmw 525i did if not more so now im not going to throw a grenade in the tent by trying to compare the handling of the two cars    maybe entrylevel luxury is a better term for these cars now    jeff,jjabbytaylor
343,March 2004,yeah a very select group are willing to pay 60k for a volkswagen boy those chevrolets    this isnt like toyota creating lexus and the groundbreaking 35k ls400 toyota had a great reputation  something volkswagen doesnt have toyota created a luxury brand from scratch and populated it with a vehicle that mirrored the big boy on the block  mb but for less money volkswagens phaeton mirrorsthe volkswagen oh theres a marketing coup    lets nail down the logic weve got a company well known for mechanical and electrical problems offering a high priced luxochrysler under the same banner as 16k economy cars and the new car most closely resembles a 2340k midsize sedan thats just brilliant    gosh i sure hope ford comes out with a plussized version of the ford and sells it for 50k thatd be keen    branding thats what its all about in the luxury arena ask mb about the maybach,blueguydotcom
344,March 2004,the phaeton will be a bigger and much costlier bust than the w8 volkswagen which went nowhere in sales and that was a 3840k car yeah volkswagen quality is in the toilet literally volkswagen execs should take a good hard look from japan you gotta have a solid foundation before you reach for the glam and glitz why not promote the audi more which never was a big seller instead of handicaping it with a near twin real smart eh    but there is good in that volkswagen techs will have even greater job security now that the phaetons out,sapparo
345,March 2004,it seems like it would be better for volkswagen to move slowly up market rather than such a large leap most reviews ive read have been pretty positive but they all question whether buyers will be willing to forgo the snob appeal to obtain a better value in their luxury cars    the phaeton is a pretty nice looking car imho and in some ways it might be nice to have a car that doesnt scream i have lots of money    as far as quality goes the bmw 7series and mercedes benz sclass have been having some quality problems of their own lately     jeff,jjabbytaylor
346,March 2004,now really the phaeton and the 7series and the sclass are not anywhere close to the near or entrylevel lux category    how about if we just say 32k to 42k as a minimum requirement for eligibility in this discussion that would at least keep us within some workable range    i want to change near to entrylevel in the title how about if i also drop performance i think that should make unnecessary some of the carryingson about what belongs here and what doesnt    let me hear what you have to say and ill make up my mind tomorrow,pat
347,March 2004,keep performanceotherwise i35 and es330 owners will be in here babbling about smooth rides,blueguydotcom
348,March 2004,im fine with your suggested changes dropping performance from the moniker should only add the es330 among the imports to the discussion as that car is the only car that is decidely nonperformance in this price cateogry    i read the pontiac5x followup test on edmunds and i pretty much agree with what the writer said the design of the interior is fine except im not a big fan of the orange lights and i actually feel that the quality of the leather seats is better than the seats in the tl or the 3 series hopefully theyll really lick the dash material quality issues in the 2005 model,jrock65
349,March 2004,is that 32k to 42k with or without options either way i guess it would have to be wouldnt it and i assume we are talking msrp numbers right i feel its a given but you just know someone will be over here saying but this guy says he knows a guy who read somewhere that this other guy bought a ctsv for 42k so well probably want to put a stop to that now and specify its msrp numbers  17 ford crew 27 67 coronet rt 14 towncountry limited 09 lsubaru hse 44car history and counting,qbrozen
350,March 2004,why cant we just accept that everyone has a different opinion of where the near luxury line is drawn    for example riez stated that he thinks the lexus is higher on the food chain than the 325i probably because it has a larger more powerful engine and he owns a couple of them    i however consider the 325i higher on the food chain than the lexus because its just as quick but more refined and mature in my opinion    price doesnt work either because of my admittedly biased opinion that the acura belongs in the same league as the 325i and lexus because it offers similar performance and luxury but only costs 26000    and then theres the mazda 6s and v6 honda which offer performance and luxury on par with many of the cars here yet they simply lack breeding brand identification    for a car to be a true nearluxury performance sedan i believe it must possess some combination of all of these traits in varying degrees    maybe a formula could be devised assigning points for luxury brand name overall performance quality interiorcockpit exterior elegance overall driving refinement,fedlawman
351,March 2004,last night i was thinking that specifically the acura would present a problem as a car that falls outside of the price requirements but that many folks would feel belongs here    i dont feel the mazda competes here just on merit of being slow in a straight line it is also lacking quite a bit in the luxury department on merit of lacking sound deadening and something i feel should be available on a car that wants to be considered luxury navigation so to me the mazda belongs here no more than the sti does    i think the honda is too closely tied to the tl if the honda is permitted then you open the doors to the nissan and toyota and then you might as well include the kia amanti hyundai hyundai350 chrysler etc etc  17 ford crew 27 67 coronet rt 14 towncountry limited 09 lsubaru hse 44car history and counting,qbrozen
352,March 2004,fedlawman my initial ranking was based on price and layout the inexpensive fwd4cyl cars like acura and 93 at bottom a stripped 325i is less expensive than an lexus has less standard equipment and a smaller engine plus the 330i is certainly higher up than the 325i thus the more expensive higher performing 330i is higher up than the lexus,riez
353,March 2004,the manufacturers are fairly clear on their intentions whether or not to compete in the near sportyluxury segment it makes decisions pretty clear to me    acura infinity bmw mercedes benz lexus etc  yes  chevrolet ford nissan honda toyota etc  no    just because an honda may have all the bases covered does not mean it should be considered for this topic,fjm1
354,March 2004,no one thinks the honda should be here i mentioned it as an example of how the name of this discussion could be misinterpreted but in no way did i suggest it should be included here    gee its amazing how some things can take on a life of their own sometimes ,pat
355,March 2004,the geo speck made from clay and epoxy has a nav so lets include that its funny how we want to exclude the poor hondaians but hey they are not in the same league now are they,chrisboth
356,March 2004,i dont know what that is but does it also have power leather seats and respectable performance if so then it would meet all the requirements i previously mentioned so maybe i need to take a look at it and maybe reevaluate my criteria  17 ford crew 27 67 coronet rt 14 towncountry limited 09 lsubaru hse 44car history and counting,qbrozen

368,March 2004,fwd cant handle high hp and torque but in entry level luxury its not an issue       this level has 270 base hp for that car it surpassed imo the threshold at 220hp in the next 2 years the entry lux cars will have 300hp to even compete  new 3 sure will and possibly the 05 g sedanor has this been quashed yet,chrisboth
369,March 2004,also some race track certainly favor fwd cars and some fwd cars have no understeer since they are so finely and hard tuned and they can even get oversteer in some setups cant they    what most suggest is that the balance from a rwd setup is superior for street cars and that the fun one has while playing with oversteer in the twisties is way more fun than getting torque feedback in your steering i would prob take an acura over the 3 in that racegreat car,chrisboth
370,March 2004,understeer and oversteer are both a loss of control    on the track or on the street neither one is a good thing the ideal car is neutral handling all the way to the limit    yes it may be fun to play with throttle induced oversteer and perhaps drift your car through a corner but if youre doing this on public roads i hope youve driven the road 1000 times walked it right before you drive to check for new hazards such as subaru potholes debris etc that werent there before and block off the road at both ends to prevent another car from coming around a corner from the other direction while your coming off an apex and tracking out    your fantasy is nice and im sure you enjoy occasionally inducing the back end of your g to get a little loose and rotate towards some imagined apex who doesnt but thats hardly a defining rwd sport sedan moment i can and do enjoy the same effect in my fwd honda    dont misunderstand me i understand where youre coming from from your last post i can see that you understand me too my response is mostly directed towards those people that continually spout the superiority of rwd over fwd with drivel such as the front wheels have to steer and driveits much for them to handle or true sports cars can only be rwd without understanding the mechanics of car control or vehicle dynamicsits pure nonsense    control your car drive smoothly follow the proper line and youll go fast and never upset the balance of the car be it a bmw or acura,fedlawman
371,March 2004,my bias for rwd comes from that ethereal shove i get when exploding out of a corner just right hit the corner perfectly you feel yourself pressed down and back in your seat ah not much like it ive yet to find that in a fwd car,blueguydotcom
372,March 2004,yes it may be fun to play with throttle induced oversteer and perhaps drift your car through a corner but if youre doing this on public roads i hope youve driven the road 1000 times walked it right before you drive to check for new hazards such as subaru potholes debris etc that werent there before and block off the road at both ends to prevent another car from coming around a corner from the other direction while your coming off an apex and tracking out    your fantasy is nice and im sure you enjoy occasionally inducing the back end of your g to get a little loose and rotate towards some imagined apex who doesnt but thats hardly a defining rwd sport sedan moment i can and do enjoy the same effect in my fwd honda    ummm i do this 2x a week at least on exit and entrance dodgeps i can see 360 degrees around i keep the car loose for about 78 seconds all the way around balancing the oversteer and understeer to find the edge of traction  this helps me undertand the limits of the car and how the car reacts to all kinds of inputs a little spin out which really wont happen with vdc on is gonna cause me no problems other than some grass in my springs    yu dont have to induce oversteer to get what bluguy describesthe shove it is something that does define the sports sedans i want to drive  in fact it defines it in such a way that i will never pay more than 20k for a fwd car  more like 18 really    as far as oversteer you realize that even without pushing the traction limit your car will slide if rwd in a turnnot much but when the front wheels are turning one way and the other wheels are driving a differnt angle  somthing gives and i assure you its the rear wheels as they align themselves to the direction of travel to the fronttheres just something about the balance you feel as the weight transfers and you propel shove down the straight road puit of a turn no honda can do this man  im not sure you really know what this is about,chrisboth

374,March 2004,the drivetrain is important but it goes hand in hand with the chassis and suspension thus we have awesome drivers with awd  audi audi quatto subaru subaru rwd  bmw 325330 infiniti pontiac5 lexus lexus fwd  acura tl saab 93 aero all of these vehicles are fun to fling around corners i have no problem with putting my money on any of them,buddhabman
375,March 2004,is that what those rwd bmw are doing in the race photo above are they shoving themselves around the race trackbehind that fwd acura   a picture is worth a thousand words the green flag dropsthe bs stops,raher
376,March 2004,lol raher good point    i wonder what went wrong with those 17 superior rwd cars    24l acura engine vs 25l 325i engine and still managed to outrun 14 of them wow    so much for a rwd theory who overlapped who,danny1878
377,March 2004,this whole discussion of auto racing reminds me of the frothing folks on bimmerfest harassing me to join their little autocross garbage    btw i woulda bought a acura over a 325i better car and better value in my eyes,blueguydotcom
378,March 2004,youre not giving your tl wot out of a corner youd end up fighting massive torque steer  assuming the engines in the sweet spot which it should be outa the corner,blueguydotcom
379,March 2004,i could point out yet again that scca handicaps cars but it would be nice of you guys to acknowledge that i exist in your little universe by perhaps calling me a name or something,dhanley
380,March 2004,i wont be making any assumption until i see another picture of this with tl instead of acura otherwise id be eating my own words like others    no theory yet but i drove acura gsr and i know which one is better gtg,danny1878
381,March 2004,blueguydotcom you obviously dont know what youre talking about massive torque steer doesnt exist in the tl there is torque steer but its mild and easily handled,kahunah
382,March 2004,youre right my bad torque steer i know its perfectly acceptable to you that the car attempt to redirect itself when accelerating at wot to each his own,blueguydotcom
383,March 2004,issue with decent handling powerful fwders normally isnt oversteer or understeer but torque steer laws of physics drive wheel and steering wheels one and the same plus front heavy tl nissan etc all afflicted question of extent not existence    what is up with the discussion tied to racing and tracks cars used for racing normally heavily modified esp in areas related to handling major tire and suspension mods everything from shocks antisway bars cross bracing bushings etc not to mention that race tracks arent like regular roads,riez
384,March 2004,rwd might be more fun for some people to drive but oversteer just like understeer makes one loose time acura and 325 is about the same size and weight engines about the same size too and both vehicles manage to post similar lap times    big plus for acura is that they build two different near luxury cars acura and tl instead of settle for one platform like bmw and mb did i know acura officials said that tl was build as a competition for 5 series but we all know that size and price wise it should and is being compared with 3series new rl on the other hand should be grate competition for 5 and e,pg48477
385,March 2004,do you have phd in physics what kind of law is that i know physics well but never heard of such law  you can probably steer your car and shift gears at the same time hondaing to your logic it should be to much to handle we all should be drivin at than,pg48477
386,March 2004,as mentioned hp to weight ratio and gearing can really make a difference in who gets to a corner first once you get there you can block the folks behind you at the point where they may have a handling advantage as long as you can cary enough exit speed to win the race between corners and have the brakes to stay there you can make it really hard for somebody to pass you cleanly track configuration can also favor one car over another    to really make a fwd race car work you have to have some lift throttle oversteer we used to trail brake and run more air pressure in the rear tires to get more oversteer once you get back on the gas the car pushes hard so you take an earlier apex than a rwd car induce some oversteer via lift throttle andor trail braking then stand on the gas and let the car understeer out from the apex of the corner with some practice and the right balance it can be a lot of fun if you dont overheat the front tires or brakes during the race,jmess
387,March 2004,when were looking at cars we tested the xtype i like the exterior but the inside wasnt impressive but not as bad as the mondeoford people are making it out to be i hope they can fix this car i read this from autospies    hot xtype r seen testing     the long awaited xtype r model due late 2004 or early 2005ish has been seen cruising the west midlands of england during final testing the fourwheel drive r will have the latest version of jaguars v6 engine using some form of forced induction to give it 330 bhp and 330 lb ft of torque there has been some whispers that the engine might not follow the usual supercharged r formula for it could well be turbocharged instead due to a lack of space under the compact saloons bonnet the 30litre engine could also be expanded to 32 litres and 250bhp an upgrade likely to debut in the whole xtype range     060 acceleration is said to be around the fivesecond mark and top speed nudging 165 mph jaguars new sixspeed manual or sixspeed automatic transmission will be standard though no news on a tiptronicsmg style box  jaguar preferring the jgate the r will stand out with its enlarged bumpers huge exhaust pipes mesh front grille dechromed exterior and 19inch alloy wheels but no silly body kit or boot spoilers unlike the other rs it will not have any additional air intakes on its bonnet internally the car will remain the same as the other models save for materialwood differences until the whole car gets a face lift in 2006,buddhabman
388,March 2004,sorry to ignore you its just that your handicap theory doesnt make one bit of difference    the scca rules are not used in the speed challenge but speed challege has its own rules to make the racing tight and exciting by equalizing the various cars thus the 325i and acura begin with similar powerweight and the same tires brand size and compound    the cars in this series are indeed heavily modified for racing but the fact remains that fwd is fwd and rwd is rwdand they both perform is fwd was truly inferior in some way then realtime racing could have entered a bmw instead of the acura they chose the acura because of its an outstanding platform to build a race car on,fedlawman
389,March 2004,you realize that even without pushing the traction limit your car will slide if rwd in a turn    if your tires are gripping then you arent sliding and if youre a good driver your car is always set so that each tire is getting maximum contact with the road    i get much more satisfaction from nailing the apex perfectly and tracking out with the car in perfect balance what youre describing is no more exciting than doing burnouts at streetlights,fedlawman
390,March 2004,ppontiac8477 if you want to learn more about torque steering in powerful fwders then just read about any review of the nissan tl nissan ser spec v neon srt4    manufacturers try to overcome the laws of physics related to this problem by many things two most basic are 1 lsd critical for powerful fwders and equal length halfshafts if one wheel transmits more power to the ground than the other it will pull the fwd car to one side because the drive wheels are also the steering wheels,riez
391,March 2004,the audi 18t wont win drag races but take that baby on the highway and it is right at home    thats funny as were so different on the freeway i loathed the 18t as i found it loud and in the case of the volkswagen poorly geared with an audi i also found the 18t to be too noisy its like a hornets nest on the freeway    the acura on the other hand had a nice long 6th that i could slip into and let the car glide along then again i prefer that i must go from 6th to 4th or 3rd when im on the freeway and i want power in my zhp in 6th im cruising and therefore i want it as quiet and loafing as possible the taller the gear the better 2500 rpm at 85 sounds perfect    dont get me wrong i liked the acura very much but to me it looked and felt too much like another honda    im not a honda fan so i didnt see or feel anything hondaish in my times with the acura,blueguydotcom
392,March 2004,do i think that it has no guts talking about the 170 hp version hmmm i guess that depends on what its mounted in mounted in a light weight car say 2600 pounds i think it would be great however if it is mounted in a 3400 pound sedan then no i dont think it is up to the task    best regards  shipo,shipo
393,March 2004,keep in mind the acura uses a dragstriplike 4731 final drive that gives it the initial launch it also then has overdrive 5th and 6th gears to offset this final drive the 6th overdrive is very deep at 0661    the lexus uses 3731 final and 085 5th    bmw has been using direct drive 5th 1001 in past e46 323i325i with various final drives under 3501 the new 6speeds bring overdrive my 98 540i6 had a 82 overdrive 6th with a 2821 final drive,riez
394,March 2004,i think the 18t offers very spirited driving for frontrack models the combination of frontrack and 6 speed or cvt work well also i think the added weight of audi and the tiptronic is a perfomace killer for the 18t if i wanted audi i would have chosen the audi 30,speedracer3
395,March 2004,yeah the tip and audi suck the life out of the poor 18t i meet people in san diego with that combo and i wonder why theyd need the audi here,blueguydotcom
396,March 2004,i take it you guys are talking about manual transmissions in the audi 18t and acura because with an automatic they are slooower than i dont know what i couldnt believe how slow the audi 18t was on a recent test drive with the air running a foot to the floor wouldnt induce a kickdown i thought the car was malfunctioning if i get an audi it will have to be the 30 model    m,merc1
397,March 2004,thanks to everyone almost on this site ive learned more about their favourite cars and what they dislike about other carsi havent decided what car to buy but have narrowed it to a list that i would be more than happy to own    keeping in mind that everyones priorities are different when choosing a car it would be interesting to know from all the regulars what would have been their second choice and why from my list below    acura tl danny1878 great car but do i really need navidvdbluetooth  acura acura fedlawman a better value than tl but does it have enough power  infinity pontiac5 chrisboth beautful car but interior upgrade for 05 coming  lexus lexus riez reliability king with flair but needs refreshing  suburaru subaru gt 2005 saw it at the autoshowa new contender  volvo volvo cant get this ford thing outta my head  honda hondamazda 6snissan nissan last resort safe family choices without putting one to sleep    i havent chosen any german cars because reliability is a major issueplease dont be offended kdblueguyspeedracer as i love all your cars but cant afford to get a new car every 2 to 4 years,ryanl1
398,March 2004,which audi 18t combo did you drive,speedracer3
399,March 2004,my second choice right now would be a tossup between the 05 subaru gt and 05 s40 t5 6speed just as big on the inside as the volvo but handles far better but have not driven or sat in either one yet so this is all based on numbers reviews and pics so its pretty much a worthless opinion at this point  17 ford crew 27 67 coronet rt 14 towncountry limited 09 lsubaru hse 44car history and counting,qbrozen
400,March 2004,the tl can be purchased without the navi now youre talking 32k or so great deal    i love power and i think the 6 speed acura wo navi is a screaming deal keep the engine over 4k and it pulls strongly,blueguydotcom
401,March 2004,you might wait for and 06 subaru gt nobody gets it all right the first model year some things are left off by design to drive demand for the next model year,jmess
402,March 2004,riez  by consensus i mean that i have read many many reviews of the acura performed by many many sources and the range for 060 has been between 68 and 79 secs this combined with my own seat of the pants indicates a lowtomid seven rating    ryanl1  personally i would choose the acura over the tl because i value handling and overall balance more than straightline acceleration my 2nd choice would probably be pontiac5 i love the 325i but i dont think the value is good unless you factory order and keep the options slim,fedlawman
403,March 2004,gotta have rwd irs and manual transmission want lsd and hid prefer i6 over v6    of course im most partial to lexus manual but my 2nd and 3rd choices would be     325i manual with sport pkg and hid   pontiac5 manual with sport pkg    but dont think i could ever buy the pontiac5 sedan the coupe is just too beautiful hope the coupe is still around when i go shopping again in about 5 years then my kids will be gone and i can get the coupe convertible or roadster ive longed for,riez
404,March 2004,in five years you may want the ford shelby cobra if a roadster is still on the list if not the hp wars will have the base coupes from lex infiniti and bmw at 400hp i imagine the pontiac5 coupe will look like the gtr concepts out now but who knows thier success is breeding many new ideas im sure    i find your comments about the g sedan strange while the coupe looks like a supercar you were looking for a sedan right i liked the fact that the coupe and sedan are so different but look similar enough i guess people love or hate the sedan and mostly love the coupe if i wasnt looking at coupes i would look at all sedans independently of the coupe sister the fact that they are different should be good  the 3 coupe and sedan are virtual twins i think the 4 series is the answer to that however,chrisboth
405,March 2004,there honestly isnt a poor choice in the bunch the only criteria is what one deems as the overriding featurescharacteristics that make one more desireable than another to the purchaser    the new rumored g refreshing as well as the rumored slew of new product from bmw will make the next few years quite interesting    while my car operates like a top i am not married to bmw having driven the epitome of the sports sedan i understand why the press and enthusiast people likes these cars but i like diversion in my car ownership experience can you say batter up for the pontiac5 of course i dont know what i will do at this point in year and a half from now,kdshapiro
406,March 2004,personally i would choose the acura over the tl because i value handling and overall balance more than straightline acceleration    fedlawman  youre not seriously suggesting that the acura is more balanced and can outhandle the tl are you because if thats what youre suggesting you need to come clean with an explainationand it better be good,kahunah
407,March 2004,lsd  bad handlingbalance    gm does sell more trucks van suv buick cadillac chevrolet gmc hummer oldsmobile pontiac saturn saab etc against 1 car tl    hmmm what else can i learn today o,danny1878
408,March 2004,well you know i was hopelessly drawn to a black ultra sport package audi 18t automatic that the dealer had on the lot i was there looking at a 2003 audi 30 dark bluebeige wthe works but the look of those new audis with the usp were just stunning so i let the guy talk me into driving one    in short i loved everything about the car except the enginepickup i dont think there is a better looking car inside or out in this class than the audi wusp however with the 18t engine and a automatic its all show and not much go the v6 is needed if you get an audi with the automatic imo    m,merc1
409,March 2004,thanks for everyones responseslurking on this site is like asking your doctorpharmacist what kind of side effects one may get    gbrozeni cant remember what your first choice was at the auto show i observed a salesman showing a 60 year old couple smitten with the s40i waited till they left and then asked him what makes the s40 that much better than the mazda 3he didnt knowthere was a barrier around the car but he let me sit in itthe vertically arranged buttons on the center console is strange lookingif you convince yourself enough that the console is trying to make a statement then youll be ok  the interior of the s40 is smaller than the volvothe back seat is cdodgeped for an adultit may not fit all baby car seatsits a beautiful car but basically too small for my needs    the subaru gt 2005 was stunningas beautiful as pontiac5tlit was on an elevated platform but i could see the interior was just as coolthe rep said they would be coming out in may and msrp around 30k usd but tba,ryanl1
410,March 2004,my first is the tl    what makes the s40 better than the mazdaudi how about more power better fit and finish more sound deadening material better seats better stereo higher quality interior materials more safety features etc etc wow you found a really bad salesman there  17 ford crew 27 67 coronet rt 14 towncountry limited 09 lsubaru hse 44car history and counting,qbrozen
411,March 2004,actually that is what i have heard in most car forumsmagazines etc the acura is better balanced probably having a lot to do with its smaller engine up front smaller body overall hey it made cd top ten cars    i for one would miss the power too much to go with a acura but it looks like a very tossable car,95gt
412,March 2004,by no means am i dissing the tl its a great car for me though the acura is just more fun to drive like 95gt said its more tossable  playful    sorry i just like it better,fedlawman
413,March 2004,yeah i know where youre coming from i once had an honda 4banger 5speed acura is a fine car i was just being playful myself ,kahunah

418,April 2004,as usual everyone in the country gets their issue before me anyway as much as i like the tl i dont know how mt could come up with italianite sheetmetal but their dynamic assesment seems to be pretty good between that socalled character line and those side sills that dont line up with the body on most of the cars ive seen the styling is almost a contrived mess imo    just by reading the previous post it seems theyre getting a little better at comparosmore sophisticated hmmmm    m,merc1
419,April 2004,now i understand why you thought the audi was a snail if you want performance out of the audi and audi you either need to chip the 18t or get the 30 next time try a frontrack cvt youll notice a considerable difference in performance,speedracer3
420,April 2004,well theres no accounting for taste i suppose you think the mitsubishi eclipse is design perfectioni dont think so    btw nothing wrong with my side sills,kahunah
421,April 2004,i wonder how folks survived in the olden days when almost all cars were rwd and nobody had traction control or snow tires    in the olden days the cars weighed 5000 lbs,kahunah
422,April 2004,is that what you think it takes to out maneuver a tl in snow  an overpriced overweight underpowered rwd mercedes benz with winter tires lol     correct an overpriced s500 however i believe that comment applies to the 3 or g as well,kdshapiro
423,April 2004,ive been driving in new england winters for almost 30 years and have never owned a fwd car i know its hard for some people to believe but it really is possible a good set of snow tires and learning how your car handles can go a long way and this is not a knock on fwd but simply to point out that at one time there was no fwd and people got thru winters just fine,iwantonetoo
424,April 2004,hm that hits a bit close to home and probably accounts for a lot of the difference of opinion i sit really vertically and i dont fit right in a lot of cars the old tl was included in this category of cars that are downright uncomfortable for me the acura and acura would have sent me for weekly chiropractor visits a friend with a honda honda coupe giggles when he takes me for rides becuase i look so uncomfortable but the 3series sedan is fine for me while the coupe is not best car i ever sat in for me was my old 900 though lots of space above the noggin even with sunroof installed the new 93 is not quite as square inside which is too bad but it still has lots of space around the head that would have been the best car ever if it had been in the shop  a lot  less so unless the tl has a lot more headroom than the old one it might be the cdodgeped overpriced one for menot that anyone else might care    dont get me started on seats designed for people with narrow shoulders bad posture and big butts ugh    i dont get how issues such as midsize and compact are decided the pontiac5 is described as a compact but its got more interior cubic footage than the tl and the front is larger and having sat in the back of the pontiac5 its not exactly tiny    dave,dhanley

426,April 2004,you guys never fail to provide some of the best reading on all of edmunds such witty writing    m,merc1
427,April 2004,not that driving in snow matters for this category but i think you wrong    it depends one of my neighboors has a 4x4 pickup with appropriate tires and a steep driveway his pickup was at the bottom of the driveway a few times this winter a lot of the fwd cars spun and spun before they made it up some of the more inclined driveways in the neighborhood    two winters ago an honda was trying to get onto the main street up a hill out of the development the honda just couldnt make it up finally backed down the hill and went around another way i made it up the hill albiet with a little help from dsc the honda was not much older than my car and the tires looked okay to me    while i generally believe a fwd with allseasons will do better in the snow than a rwd with allseasons the sweeping generalization that fwd is better in the snow than rwd is just not true,kdshapiro
428,April 2004,it has been my experience that it comes down to skill more than anything else that and common sense avoid snow drifts hills etc when you can if youre in a rwd car but this doesnt mean fwd cars are invincible either especilly in the hands of person that thinks a fwd car can go anywhere i too have seen all types of vehicles rwd fwd awd get stuck usually due to people trying to execute silly manuvers in deep snow like they dont have to make any type of adjustment to their driving style due to the type of car theyre driving    m,merc1
429,April 2004,the new tl does have much more room for the driver than the old i couldnt fit in the old one either unless i tilted the seat so far back that i could barely reach the steering wheel but i just fit in the new one perfectly well maybe about another quarter inch of seat travel would at least give me the choice of more than one seating position but its fine as is  17 ford crew 27 67 coronet rt 14 towncountry limited 09 lsubaru hse 44car history and counting,qbrozen
430,April 2004,can anyone venture why tl does so badly in 1000 braking it came pretty close to 93 and cts in 60mph braking but in 100 mph it takes 2030 feet longer than those two and 50 ft longer than stupendous pontiac5    weight distribution    tl  61 front 39 rear  cts  5446  93  5347  i was surprised too   pontiac5  5248    pretty much what youd expect really with 61 already in front it would be more like 80 during hard braking and the rotors are probably aleady hot hauling the car down from 60,dhanley
431,April 2004,very plausible but just to be sure id like to check braking and weight distribution of honda nissan and nissan    if thats the problem why did honda make such a front heavy car honda used to mean meticulous engineering    merc thanks for the compliment but tl fans dont see the humor anywhere i can tell you that but im ready for their onslaught,mariner7
432,April 2004,that is an statement that perhaps needs to be modified to a 330i equipped with every available option is 45k i never buy any vehicle with every available option with the exception of buying japanese cars without the choice of options no person i know of buys a car with every available option even those that opt for the extremely highend cars    now we all recognize there is a different value scale between japanese and german vehicles    i came to the 45k estimate based on the web site of bmw of mountain view from autonation linked from edmunds most of their 330 inventory was 43 or 44k a lot of it was coupes but still    if you add things like the premium package nav system leather xenons 17 wheels and the sport package which increases hp to 235 you get to about 45k    that is about 10k more than a tl nav isnt it,wco81
433,April 2004,i dont think honda set out to make a noseheavy car i think it probably would have cost a few thousand extra to engineer in weight distribution and they felt  quite possibly correctly  that most people would be more enticed to buy based on lower sticker price or more features than shifting weight around on a car like the nsx or the s2000 where performance is padodgeount they do distribute the weight heck a lot of sporty car owners never drive aggressively i made an lexus salesman nearly wet his pants with how i test drove the lexus and i didnt think i was doing anything special    dave,dhanley
434,April 2004,is 5050 dist at least thats what they were saying in 2003 is the new engine heavier,exalteddragon1
435,April 2004,i got the info from a few official sources such as  httpwwwcapitalpontiacgmcanadacomenglishvehiclescadillac  ctsctsdetailshtml    i bet the 32l is 5050 and the 36l is a bit heavier not by an amount anyone should lose any sleep over    dave,dhanley
436,April 2004,the reason for the nose heavy bias seems kind of obvious to me a powerful v6 and a beefy transaxle all packaged in the nose of the car wheres the mystery    that the only other fwd car in the above list had nearly the balance typical of rwd cars seems to be the result of the much smaller physical size of the mill and greater attention to detail i too am pleasantly surprised at the frontrear balance of the 93    best regards  shipo,shipo
437,April 2004,i wonder how folks survived in the olden days when almost all cars were rwd and nobody had traction control or snow tires    actually in the olden days of rwd and biasply tires almost everyone did have snow tires it wasnt until radial tires and fwd became common that people started assuming that they could get through a winter without snow tires at least in michigan i had studded snow tires on my 69 pontiac or i would have been pretty helpless in a typical winter around here,gordonwd
438,April 2004,my 3l was about 40k msrp with the these options now i recognize the price went up but not by thousands    1 premium  2 step  3 hk upgrade  4 cold weather package  5 i might have missed one or two    thats everything i want in a car anyway nav to me is the biggest waste of money i am researching a garmin no sport either the roads around here have craters as big as the moon,kdshapiro
439,April 2004,you add things like the premium package nav system leather xenons 17 wheels and the sport package which increases hp to 235 you get to about 45k    um the performance package increases horsepower to 235 and you get 18 inch rims with it    my perf zhp with leather and xenons  no navi as thats the most useless thing since the fanny pack  had a sticker of 43k i paid a few hundred below 40k for it,blueguydotcom
440,April 2004,folks also put chains on their tires    dont see that anymore either  17 ford crew 27 67 coronet rt 14 towncountry limited 09 lsubaru hse 44car history and counting,qbrozen
441,April 2004,my tl is fitted with brembos    acura tl  600 mph 115 feet braking performance is topnotch too with 60to0 stops averaging a short neat 115 feet our drivers were very impressed with our 6speeds alldisc abs brakes with brembo front calipers results are comparable to some recent porsches weve tested  motorweek    thats rightporsches,kahunah
442,April 2004,me thinks that 600 is a little easier on the brakes than 1000     best regards  shipo,shipo
443,April 2004,ive done that a few times like i saidno worries ,kahunah
444,April 2004,take one article out of one magazine and that justifies the tls brakes being more than adequate i dont think so     you can not use sales volume to justify the tl being a great car i read in an earlier post about mcdonalds being at the top of the fast food chain they are along with many of franchises why not because of product it is all branding why has madonna done so well for such a long time is she the best singer you ever heard no of course not it is all branding    you need a good car not the best of the bunch to be a big hit and that is what the tl is how well you market that automobile will take care of the rest    the tl is not the second coming of christ as some people hear lead us to believe,gpwatfrd
445,April 2004,theres a reason to buy one i think these are the types of comnments that inadvertantly give some people confindence in thier purchase where there should be none    the pontiac5 standard package brakes are seemingly the best on any sports sedan short of an m why almost every tester not just one raved about the stopping power and 1 even mentioned that just one italian supercar came to the same stopping distance as the g sedan    when one says they are porsche worthy but the rest say soso or not so greatthats why they all have to be taken with a grain,chrisboth
446,April 2004,thats why i want to see data on the other fwds with big v6 throw in toyotatoyota too i want to see if its a honda thing or a big fwd thing,mariner7
447,April 2004,none of the cars mentioned on this board are the second coming many on this board just cant face the fact that tl offers the biggest and best bang for the buck in this categoryend of story,kahunah
448,April 2004,i guess it depends upon your perspective for my tastes fwd cars need not apply in fact awd cars are only considered after being given a seriously hairy eyeball in my book and remember i am a staunch bmw supporter the best bang for the buck on the market these days is the pontiac5    best regards  shipo,shipo
449,April 2004,not with that interior,kahunah
450,April 2004,many on this board just cant face the fact that tl offers the biggest and best bang for the buck in this categoryend of story    but for many people the best buy for the buck isnt the best option some want the best for the limit they set i didnt care that bmw was over 40k only that it satisfied 80 of my desire for a price i found acceptable the tl if it had been out would have hit about 7577 the price difference wasnt enough to make me look to the tl if the 330i had come in at 50k and i hadnt swung the deal i got maybe the tl would win out    price wasnt the final determining factor though sorry if i cared about bang for the buck in 03 i would gone for an sti and just obliterated pretty much all non supercars in my path,blueguydotcom
451,April 2004,agreed on the appearance ive seen the new audi in person and its really bland the 5 is the only one that stands out as different and sporty im getting bangled    the rl reminds me a bit too much of a super sized es330 i think its the huge headlamps    i want to drive a 6 speed tl with that shawd system and 300 hp that could be fun,blueguydotcom
452,April 2004,dear forum i never thought this would happen to me when i was a teen i loved the look of the ford stocker from the late 60s i used to draw updated versions of it  smooth bits offsetting the rough edges larger wheels etc fast forward 15 years and ford making that car i dig the look and power of the ford gtr minus the spoiler of course  yuck i need to go home and drive my bimmer to cleanse my soul of ever entertaining notions of a 500 hp ford,blueguydotcom
453,April 2004,although derivative id rather take the m45 it has a nice interior and sounds like it is a barn stormer    blue    are you going schizo on usi thought you hated american cars with a passion,speedracer3
454,April 2004,anytime the car is an auto with premium package sports package and metallic paint ivory pearl with black interior i like the white exterior with the dark interior i also think the black on silver inside looks good the only other options that were available were the rear spoiler and the overpriced navigation system,gpwatfrd
455,April 2004,rl technology and its innovations are astounding not too fond of its exterior the front side reminds me of an eshonda while the butt looks like an oversized honda for exterior i prefer the tl or the previous 5 series    m45 nice interior but exterior also reminds me of pontiac5 sedan i think rl has better technology and innovations but 35l engine with 300hp only give me a break,danny1878
456,April 2004,are you going schizo on usi thought you hated american cars with a passion    rules were made to be broken i like the mad max look man this goes back to my teen years  its like the way my ears perk up when i hear theme songs from horrible 70s and 80s sitcoms essentially its primal id even go all black for a car like that  and i swore never to own another black car gunmetal rims nice weekend carlol    now that i think about it a dark dark gunmetal gray would be pretty wicked    im sure itll be cheaper than the bmw i was drooling over last week that was based purely on the engine,blueguydotcom
457,April 2004,some more m45 photos    httpwwwnissannewscomhttpwwwnissannewscomnissannewsproductsreljanel2002072105400shtml    hyundai on m45 concept then hyundai on photo library    the more i look at it the more i like it the two speakers mounted on the shoulders of each front seat is interesting that really brings the sound close to the ear i guess theyll tone down the output of those speakers relative to the body mounted speakers,jrock65
458,April 2004,35l engine with 300hp only    yeah that is disappointing especially with awd makes it tough to compete with a 340hp v8,kahunah
459,April 2004,its good output  sort of then again we know bmw gets 350 out of a 32 liter 6  bmw csl,blueguydotcom
460,April 2004,im also kind of disappointed that the car only comes with a 5 speed auto bmw and mercedes benz are using 6 and 7 speed automatics in most of their cars these days    jeff,jjabbytaylor
461,April 2004,its the topic police again reporting for duty hey its what they pay me for ya know     why dont we take the connissantion about the m45 the audi and the rl to the discussion jrock started for that class of vehicle here luxury performance sedans that one is specifically linked to those three discussion lists so thats where you want to post your comments if you want them to be seen by the majority of our visitors and members who are interested in those vehicles    if anyone has forgotten our topic vehicles in this discussion are listed here pat mar 19 2004 634pm,pat
462,April 2004,bmw 340i 345i does anyone have any info on the next generation bmw 3 series engines as far as displacement hp etc and will they show up in the next generation 3 series the pontiac5 and acura tl has made it very interesting by out horsepoweringout torqueing the 3,portknoxxa
463,April 2004,dont forget its only a concept tl concept also had 300hp not 270 so hp can go up or down before this car hits show room in any case i think 300hp is good enof to compete with 6 cylinders versions of is competition one of the reasons m45 did so poorly is luck of v6 most of gs e and 5 are being sold with 6 cylinders in fact 80 of gs is i6 i dont think acura wants to spend money on something they cant sell if the come up with full size sedan maybe they will build v8 this way theyll be able to use the engine for two vehicles and maybe full size suv    in any case exterior does not look exiting at all to bland interior is very nice,pg48477
464,April 2004,bmw will introduce new 35l engine for 535 i think new 3 will have current 30 standard and 35 as an option,pg48477
465,April 2004,and will they show up in the next generation 3 series the pontiac5 and acura tl has made it very interesting by out horsepoweringout torqueing the 3    funny how those numbers still dont translate to more powerful automobiles    ill take my 30 liter 235 hp zhp over the supposedly more powerful 270 hp 32 of the tl and the 260 hp 35 liter vq in the g    if bmw goes to even a 32 l we know they can pull out over 300 hp and as weve seen those german horses tend to be bigger than japanese ones,blueguydotcom
466,April 2004,ill take my 30 liter 235 hp zhp over the supposedly more powerful 270 hp 32 of the tl and the 260 hp 35 liter vq in the g     lot more people think otherwise,pg48477
467,April 2004,supposedly there was supposed to be a 30l twin turbo i6 in the works but that seems to have gone quietso perhaps it was dropped    the twin turboing was supposed to be sequential tooso a smaller turbo for quick spoolup and a big one for boost at high rpms was supposed to be 385hp or some such    dave,dhanley
468,April 2004,funny how those numbers still dont translate to more powerful automobiles    ill take my 30 liter 235 hp zhp over the supposedly more powerful 270 hp 32 of the tl and the 260 hp 35 liter vq in the g    isnt that because the 3series body is lighter than the tl or g bodies,wco81
469,April 2004,lot more people think otherwise    lets have another connissantion about purchase numbers thatll be really productive,dhanley
470,April 2004,lets dont and say we did eh        its lots more interesting to talk about what we like and dislike than what the abstract numbers say seems to me,pat
471,April 2004,i actually would buy a 3 series over any tl pontiac5 etc id even buy a 325i auto i think that bmw just proves that they engineer one or some of the best cars you can buy i mean an bmw with a 32l i think with 333 hp and  torque and lets not forget the performance pkg on the 330 only increased 10 hp and is still underpowered compared to pontiac5 tl and it all around out performs a pontiac5 and tl i would love to see bmw continue their engines wo turbosuper dodges they seem to do so much with naturally aspirated smaller displaced engines on all of their cars compared to their rivals isnt lexus dropping a v8 in the is 300 and what about the rs4 from audi bmw should bring back the bmw sedan in a hurry to put these other car makers back in their place just for the record i do not own any of these cars ive had a 2004 mitsu mitsubishi gts for 3 months less hp than honda v6 and nissan 35 but the gts kills em with the 250 tourqe and sport tuned suspension,portknoxxa
472,April 2004,the residual is just under 24 ks  the point i am making that you can get the bmw listed around 47 to 49 ks and still pay less net than the tl   i was very surprised tooi think bmw is trying in a big way to grab the market share and the deals are there driving both cars i must admit there is no contestin my opinion there is no front wheel car that comes close to bmw handling  not to mention the all paid service for 3 yrvolvo000 kmwarranty 4 yrvolvo000 km road assistance and choice of tires   i made the deal with bmw after driving hondaacuras since 1975 ,webby1
473,April 2004,i hope you got 330 with performance package because 325 doesnt come close,pg48477
474,April 2004,dont kid yourself i know pontiac5 do outrun 330i i dont own pontiac5 also    lighter or not 060 stats proves it,danny1878
475,April 2004,dont kid yourself i know pontiac5 do outrun 330i i dont own pontiac5 also    060 in 56 when did the pontiac5 sedan do that havent seen that stat from any mag    the less powerful 330i performance package with its smaller 30 liter inline 6 pulls to 60 in 5956 seconds depending whose numbers you believe  bmw says 59 and they always go conservative    youd think with another halfliter in displacement the supposedly more powerful pontiac5 would be quicker or what about the tls 270 hp v6    gearing horses whatever it is bmw does more with less than the others what happens when bmw puts a 32l in a 3 series oh then were talking about 060 romps in the 4s and over 330 hp suddenly the 35 liter vq doesnt seem all that impressive    who ever asked about horsepower wars do they even realize that bmw 1998 car design still bests these latecomers that bmw currently makes a 32 liter engine that will obliterate the vq and tl,blueguydotcom
476,April 2004,congrats and enjoy the ride looks like bmw is really trying hard to increase their market share what colour combo did you get and is it auto or manual,kahunah

478,April 2004,id rather have the car cost less pontiac5 tl and have similar performance than have lower engine displacement 330i and have similar performance,jrock65
479,April 2004,sigh automobile in their october 2003 issue had pontiac5 infiniti do 060 in 56 sec same as mitsu evo in the same test they looked at 12 or 13 sport sedans even though the g was superior in practically all the performance categories it placed 3rd overall behind the acura and the 325i  i am frankly surprised that this comparison test is hardly ever mentioned,knr5
480,April 2004,car and drive 330i with performance package  56 seconds    httpcaranddrivercomarticleaspsectionid3articleid6 978pagenumbesubaru      i think i saw a 59 once for the manual pontiac5 someone here has a 56 if thats so thats great but wait a second thatd be in line with a car sporting half a liter less displacement and 25 hp less    jrock65  id rather have the car cost less to each his own im not looking for bang for the buck  or id own an sti but i do find it hilarious that people are saying the pontiac5tl is hot on the 3 series when both are 2 years old or less while the bimmer debuted in 98 as a 99  6 model years ago thats like taking on lennox lewis at the end of his career and beating your chest over it it took infiniti until 2002 to come up with a bmw dodge acura 2003    even now you know that bmw 32 means at any second they can slip it and the m moniker into a sedan and itll eat tls and gs for lunch    what exactly are honda and nissan doing with their big engines and engineering obviously not much if the best they can do is go toetotoe with the guy who is on his last legs shouldnt they be roundly beating him now    have a good night guys and before i leave i dig and respect both the tl and pontiac5 i just find the hp snorting comical given the results,blueguydotcom
481,April 2004,i have the sport package and the tire size is 20555 zr 16 i originally had the dunlop sp8000s i then switched to bridgestone potenza re940s which i actually like less they are very firm and noisier than the dunlops both zrated    clarification on my previous post i liked the steering feel of the pontiac5 but when hitting bumps while in a turn at high crusing speed moderate amount of lateral gs the steering jerked quite readily while my audi does not do that yet the audi retains an excellent road feel as does the pontiac5,tlong
482,April 2004,yes i know the road from mt vernon to fairhaven i have relatives in bham and go there a lot i live in maltby just off of highway 9 i wouldnt recommend spirited driving on the road from mt vernon to fairhaven as there is a lot of slow traffic as for bicyclesi am a cyclist myself so i appreciate anyone who looks out for me ,raher
483,April 2004,as you cruise down the highway passing all the slower cars and enjoying the view you smile and think to youselfthis is one great road car    i know how you feel too kahunah like you own the road     i dont go over speed limit thou but i like it when someone try to test the cars acceleration and they usually slow downafter they got the message as i will too if they dont i know you know this    now i really enjoy turning onoff onto dodge but i always limit myself not to do that at night i need to see the road clearly be safe is more important nothing can make me more happier than being inside this car ,danny1878
484,April 2004,i know exactly what youre talking about it seems to me that thats part of the german car specialness they provide good feedback while not exhibiting many of the foibles other performance cars posess if all we want is leather gadgets and lots of hp we all have to feel bad about the 33k 57l pontiac in the end arguing that one luxury car bests another based on hp is like telling me that i should prefer brick cheese to brie because its more cheese per dollar    but on topic the best road trip i took for pure driving fun was driving from hyundai fe to taos theres two routes both gorgeous once leaving taos there was a row of 20 cars all bumper to bumper climbing uphill at 25mph i knew id never be able to pass the entire caravan on the windy road ahead so i dropped to second and passed 25 cars on a long uphill redlining third at the end it paid off there was hardly any other cars on the road following that and the twisties were great fun    dave,dhanley
485,April 2004,tdodgelining seems to correlate strongly with tire tread patterns as well  see any online tire store reviews of similarly sized high performance tires    my own view is that fwd vs rwd is not a factor in tdodgelining  its tirerelated    as for torquesteer in the tl ive experienced a little bit of it in my two week old automatic offtheline as others have noted but it hasnt been problematic car and driver has noted that torque steer is far more bothersome in the manual,bosoxin04
486,April 2004,its come down to the wire with in the next 3 weeks now i plan on getting a new vehicle yet ive narrowed it down to these two cars the acura tl wo nav and mb c class there are things i like on both cars and things i dislike and ive come to the point where i dont know what else to do now in my opinion the tls interior is better than the cs but well the mb has some nice features like tele aidmaint minder which tl has too but the mb is more indepth and rain sensing winshield wipers and auto up and down for all for windows yet the tl has the surround sound a first for cars so what would you guys suggest anything else i should try and figure out between these two cars im thinkin there pretty much equal only thing that bothers me about the mercedes benz really is that the c230 sport sedan is kinda underpowerd which can be remadeed by getting the manny which im still learning how to drive please help,cjs2002
487,April 2004,i prefer the cclass but if you care about reliability go with the acura mb is having tons of quality issues lately unless you dont mind visiting your mb dealer often acura is the answer two folks in my office own sclass mbs and there is always something wrong they are getting rid of them    good luck,speedracer3
488,April 2004,acura is more reliable better built suzukier better handling and a better car all the way around for less money a comparable c class will run far more than that tls 3435k and you get a smaller less chevrolet less powerful less reliable car with the c    wheres the problem,blueguydotcom
489,April 2004,yea but as my father would say a mercedes benz is a mercedes benz ive heard of problems with reliability but my father seems to think thats not true  i like the fact that its a mercedes benz and my uncle has one and has no problems with it but i dont know ive yet to hear anything serious about the tl minus the tires flat spotting but im changing those out anyways so i dont care personally i like the tl better even though that in my area i can get the mb with the same equipment or relatively close for the same price yet when i say same price im taking the number from the tmv on the mercedes benz and comparing it to the msrp on the tl and i know im not paying sticker for the tl so in my opinion the tl is comes out cheaper i just dont want to make the wrong choice and be stuck with a car also i plan on tinting the windows will it pose any problem with either car if i get them tinted i want them tinted for summers ause it helps to keep the car cooler thankx,cjs2002
490,April 2004,from someone who has owned an 03 c230 sport sedan 6spd manual for a little over one year the cclass is clearly the better choice first of all the rwd and sport suspension make the c class a better handling car sorry tlacura lovers but i am another rwd or bust kind of guy secondly my car msrp was 32k and i paid 31k for c2 package rain sensor power rear sunshade and power sunroof 6 disc changer heated seats and premium bose system imo the look of the c class is much classier and all around better looking than the non descript honda lineup especially the sport sedans 17inch wheeltire combo and sidefrontrear skirting and if cjs2002 can wait for the 05 mb cclass sport sedan the interior is far better looking than the 03 or 04 the tl interior is a nice piece but it still screams honda and in the reliability department my car has only been to the shop for its one routinefree scheduled maintenance at 10k i currently have 14k miles    honestly cjs2002 you wont go wrong with either car but the c class was an easy choice for me last january when i ordered mine even over the much loved pontiac5 sedan   imo i just dont love the exterior or interior of the g now the pontiac5 coupe is the car i would love to own but my little 1 year old and his car seat were not a good match for that back seat    happy shopping,sweetc230
491,April 2004,do you think the refershed c class interior is less good as well they did just upgrade the cclass interior    i dont know what id get if i were to pick between those id try to live with each for a day  traffic shopping highway  and see how i felt after that    remember what some magazine or guy on the web tells you plays no role in your personal satisfaction    dave,dhanley
492,April 2004,if for 05 the c230 was getting a power boost then yea id get it probably when i drove the c it just seemed a tad sluggish though i must commend it in the fact that its as tight and quite as a button this weekend im going to try and get the dealor ship to let me take each car out for a day and just drive them dont care if its a loaner or what not just as long as i see how it drives  the acura and mb dealorships are right acrost the street from one another so it makes looking and comparing easierits come down now to which one offers the features i like better both are great cars i just need to figure out what will suite me better now,cjs2002
493,April 2004,i have a c240 with a 6speed and 32000 miles the car is a little under powered for me and that is why i am on the pontiac5 board thinking about a new car in about a year i will say the reliability on my mb has not been too bad the fuel gauge was about 2 gallons off and replaced the sending unit and the tape deck door would not open  the entire head unit was replaced everything under warranty so that was 2 problems if i bought a japanese car i would expect 1 problem in 32000 miles the car is solid as brick  no squeeks or rattles at all hondaing to the last service my  brake pads are not even at 50 wear which is not bad cosidering 80 of my driving is in the city the 6speed can easily get 30 miles per gallon on the highway i do wish the interior was a bit wider and like i said i want more power however whenever i see an officer around a blind bend with a radar gun i am glad i dont have the extra hp whatever i have i will use you do really need to take both out on an extended drive i have seen photos of the new c dash board and it looks much better,darnac
494,April 2004,yes i looked at the c230 mainly because it has a bit more umf behind it when i test drove one i found it to be very quite and rifined yet i had the dealorship guy with me so i wasnt able to actually consintrate because he kept yappin im going to go with my father this weekend and drive both cars for an extended time maybe take one out for the day my dad refuses to let dealers come with us so hes comming with me this weekend to take a look and finally make a decision between the two cars,cjs2002
495,April 2004,i just dont want to make the wrong choice and be stuck with a car    roll the dice cars are a lousy purchase anyway which ever one stirs the soul is the one to buy imho i bought a bmw  and that was after my horrendous experience with another german car  knowing itd be a poorly built vehicle it hasnt been as shoddy as my volkswagen but my bmw certainly not as well made as my last japanese car  a dowdy but solid 91 nissan stanza still my bimmer is fun and makes me smile regardless of the trips to the dealer if it were out of warrantyitd be for sale,blueguydotcom
496,April 2004,yes i will sell my mb before warranty goes byebye if repairs are coming out of my pocket i will not own a german car i am too cheap,darnac
497,April 2004,if you taking mt c230 might have enof power but not with at in my mind tl is a better car it handles just as good as rwd c230 has more power better trany infiniti and the car cost much less mb does look classy but i would wait when im 40 to take classy car like that,pg48477
498,April 2004,i plan to get my windows tinted mainly to reduce heat in the summer my question is will tinting the windows mess with any systems of the car i know the mb has the rain sensing windshield wipers but i dont know if it would affect that or not and how bout the tl will it affect any of its systems though i dont think the one wo nav has anything that it would affect but im not sure any one know,cjs2002
499,April 2004,geez    i came here to learn about the pontiac5x as im considering buying one you know its from infiniti all wheel drive is the nav any good any experiences to talk about after flipping back four pages ive read about every car except the pontiac5    anyone know where that forum is grin,seekperfectcar
500,April 2004,you seem really forded on the frills    maybe you should look into which one has better safety record because while youre futzing with the auto winshield wipers or the nav you might get into trouble,wco81
501,April 2004,not looking for any with the nav nor do i really care about the auto wipers yet i must admit their cool i just dont want to do anything that may lead to an infamous trip to dealorship i wish to try and avoid going to the dealorship for anything i might cause ,cjs2002
502,April 2004,yea but as my father would say a mercedes benz is a mercedes benz    nothing could be further from the truth dont worry about what daddy thinks unless hes footing the bill    a 3 pointed star emblem does not automatically make it a great car unless you just like the idea of having a mercedes benz if thats the case welcome to poser city,sawyerjon
503,April 2004,i second that    cjs2002  you should also be concerned at the fact that not one mercedes benz model is recommended by consumer reportsnot a one all the models have predicted reliability ratings that are either fair or poor,kahunah
504,April 2004,another thing you can spend 80k mercedes benz and if there is a warranty repair they rent you a car if your mb needs to stay for a few days no mb loaners at least none here in the sflorida dealers lexus gives you a lexus loaner jag gives you a jag audi gives you an audi i think it is nuts,speedracer3

507,April 2004,speedracer3  in nj all of the mercedes benz dealers i have dealt with give you either a c240 or ml350    cjs2002  i have tinted the windows on several cars they have a tint which keeps the car cooler than your regular tint you would find in the store i dont know the type but ask the place who will install it if they are mazdar i have had every type of vehicle you could imagine tinted from infinitilexusmercedes benzfordetc never had a problem,gpwatfrd
508,April 2004,hi there from your question im guessing that you are using the makemodel search tools to display discussions that involve the pontiac5 and perhaps misunderstanding your results    this entry level performance sedans discussion is about a number of vehicles  you can read pat mar 19 2004 634 to see the list    our discussions get categorized based on what they are about since this discussion includes the pontiac5 that vehicle is one of the categories and that means when you list discussions that include the pontiac5 this one shows up but it doesnt mean that the only subject here is the pontiac5    i hope this helps explain things but if not feel free to drop me an email    oh and it seems that qbrozens link goes to messages that are a couple of years old  here is a link that will get you to the current messages infiniti pontiac5    thanks qbrozen  you have to drop the  at the end of a link in order to get to the current posts,pat
509,April 2004,not sure why that is happening in your neck of the woods    me neither they must not have enough mbs to give out maybe they sell too many mb dealers here in s florida have an rental car places right in the dealerships shrug,speedracer3
510,April 2004,do they still use film and then manually apply it with some kind of adhesive    becuase back in the day when i had it done the thing started to bubble horribly in 3 or 4 years    it was the worst on hatchbacks because the back hatch faced the sun more directly side windows didnt have as much of a problem    so the 200300 they charge you doesnt seem like a good deal    the factory tint jobs must put the tinting inside the glass or something because they dont seem to have the bubbling problem,wco81
511,May 2004,yep the tranny is definitely not as smooth as the bmw units i like that the pontiac5 has a shorter throw than the bmw though    to me the pontiac5 tranny was better than the vague notchy binding junk bmw uses in its trannies neither car had honda smooth trannies but id rather the trucklike feel and vibration of the gs manual to the volkswagenish junk bmw uses,blueguydotcom

514,May 2004,sure    3 big mac is much better than 192k porsche    20k chevrolet10k kia sephia of course better than 192k porsche    are they at the same segment same price range same type of carsedan do people crossshop them if i need to eat will i buy a diamond instead of food lol same old logic try a new one     its a common knowledge that people compare burger to burger not burger to diamond maybe not in lala land eh     btw its only sales figures comparison dont be delusional its where the market makes its statement not you or me ,danny1878
515,May 2004,doesnt bmw use gm tranniesi remember hearing that somewhere,speedracer3
516,May 2004,well sort of if im not mistaken bmw is eliminating or has eliminated the gm tranny from their lineup and is switching or has switched over to all zf gearboxes at least for the automatic transmissions what im unsure about is if they are still using the gm version in their awd 3series offerings which i believe iswas the last application of that transmission    regarding the gm transmission it iswas not your run of the mill unit as is available here in the us on any old gm car this unit was built in a french factory and was not used for any cars sold in american except for maybe the now defunct catera    best regards  shipo,shipo
517,May 2004,well im not the one repeating the same old volume argument desperate for salesfigure validation    are they in the same segment maybe one might question if the honda tl is in the same segment as the bmw and if the 30 extra hp is worth the price premium over the honda,dhanley
518,May 2004,a car that isnt next to you at every stop light    that is one nice thing about the lexus nice car that isnt too common    would be interesting to see the demographic breakdown of buyers age sex and income the age of the lexus average buyer is about 30 the lowest for all toyotalexus products even scion,riez
519,May 2004,maybe in omaha ne the is 300 is not common here in s florida they are a dime a dozen then again so are bmw audis and everything else you can dream of,speedracer3
520,May 2004,one also might question if less hp is worth the price premium over the honda overpriced     posting a sales figure comparison doesnt need your vaildation aight the truth is out there lol,danny1878
521,May 2004,hondaing to our host pat and all magazines this cars are in the same segment if you think otherwise maybe you in the wrong thread,pg48477
522,May 2004,would be interesting to see the demographic breakdown of buyers age sex and income the age of the lexus average buyer is about 30 the lowest for all toyotalexus products even scion    its common in parts of southern california orange county is teeming with lexuss driven by kids same with mira mesa ca,blueguydotcom

524,May 2004,the tl is a brand new redesign which is an improvement over its predecessor in more ways than one so it does not surprise me when the sales figures reflect significant volume in april get back to me in a year from now,gpwatfrd
525,May 2004,i only posted a sales figure comparison and i didnt make any statement at all dont be delusional its the markets statement that shows these car are going to the right direction i cant change the markets statement neither can you    there is no overall better car one can value luxury more than performance while others dont and some prefer both even in performance dept alone it consist of acceleration cornering slalom etc none of these sedans has them all    about getting back to you a year from now how about going back at time when your favourite car was new what was its highest record     i hope its apple versus apple not burger ,danny1878
526,May 2004,im not entirely certain why someone is still so enamored with owning something popular i buy what i like and the world be damned apparently not all of us live for ourselves,blueguydotcom
527,May 2004,the whining back and forth about the sales volumes is really appealing not but the point that came through at the end is true all the cars in this segment are very good at doing what theyre made to do and selecting between them reflects more on the priorities of the buyer than the superiority of one car versus another the tl is selling well because it is currently fitting the priorities of more buyers with 3040 k to spend on a performance sedan than the others yes a big part of that is subjective new modelstyling buzz from good reviews but when you take a bunch of cars that all perform great its the subjective stuff that makes the difference    i bought the tl because it performs great i never had a problem with torque steer for the information of those overly attached to rwd and in the end the styling and technology love the bluetooth were better than the rest especially for the     you guys pick what you like the world be damned but everyone else is buying what they like and a lot of us like the tl best,grri03
528,May 2004,a car that isnt next to you at every stop light  who cares really some may i dont    that is one nice thing about the lexus nice car that isnt too common  sales could be better,kdshapiro
529,May 2004,since i dont play the more is necessarily better game i will only say if one adds up all of the 3 series sales in all engine sizes in all body styles it exceeds 6711,kdshapiro
530,May 2004,im always much more interested in reading how individuals feel about different characteristics of different vehicles than anything about sales figures ive never yet met one person in the town hall or anywhere else who bases a buying decision on number sold for any given vehicle    why not just discuss our opinions of the merits and demerits of the cars in this class i find it hard to believe that any of you have really formed your opinons about these vehicles based on how many have been sold,pat
531,May 2004,i heard acura didnt think mp3 was good enough and opted for dvda a format which doesnt really have much content    maybe the other manufacturers are more attuned to the market,wco81
532,May 2004,most people dont have hdtv and only about 50 of the network content is now hd heck i dont even watch tv really arrested development anduh the nfl but i still bought hd if im gonna watch tv im gonna see it at its best    if i were to record id buy an hd recorder i could record with a vcr the mp3 of video but i wouldnt want that kind of video quality    likewise if i bought a tl id find dvda content because its far superior to cds far and mp3 forgetaboutitjunk,blueguydotcom
533,May 2004,your analogy doesnt make sense you are comparing two different things at two vastly different prices she is listing vehicles in the same class that are about the same price get a grip,mdhauke
534,May 2004,just a note on bmw using gm transmissions i had a 99 bmw with a gm automatic and have to say it is the best automatic ive ever driven including the one in my pontiac5x right now smooth to a fault quick to downshift always had the right gear selected and never gave me a bit of problems    give gm credit where credit is duemy understanding is that their automatics are benchmarks for the rest of the automotive world,rderizans
535,May 2004,it is my understanding that the gm built transmission in the 323ibmw was actually a bmw design that gms french factory simply executed i cannot honestly say that ive ever heard gm being praised as having the benchmark automatic gearbox funny thing is that during the 1960s and 1970s it was gm paying chrysler royalties on quite a few of the parts in their turbohydro automatics of day go figure     best regards  shipo,shipo

543,May 2004,youve all been bad really bad involves two trained monkeys chocolate syrup and a spatula    jmess i remember an article last year by a magazine called grassroots motorsports good mag  just for giggles they did a full track session with a couple of vintage porsches vs the tow vehicle you guessed it the tow vehicle was a honda ody and it lapped competitively with the porsches    the bar just keeps getting higher    10 years ago the only sedan that could run like my pontiac5 had an m on the tail now weve got tl is bmw going like stink and the ms amgs and the new maserati are light years beyond that its a great time to be an enthusiast    hope gas prices dont put the kaibosh on it my car get terrible mileage,fjm1
544,May 2004,i dont think rising gas prices is going to have a major impact look at the cl and sl65 amg most powerful production mbs ever they make a 400hp bmw look like your grandmas buick buick then theres the buggatti the bentley gt maserati mc12 etc its funny to think that cars like the dodge cuda 442 etc could be embarrased by todays acura tls    now all i need is a hybrid shawd acura rl pushing 350400hp toyota and honda technology has the potential to majorly shake up the performance industry i think theres rumors of an awd lexus lexusgt with 470hp getting 40mpg now that is having ones cake and eating it too,lexusguy
545,May 2004,hope gas prices dont put the kaibosh on it my car get terrible mileage    huh i just drove to vegas this week in my bimmer running an average of 90 but more realistically over 90 as i had to fight traffic to get out of san diego at 5pm i got 26 mpg that was including one segment of about 70 miles at over 100 mph and occasional bursts to over 120 26 mpg isnt too shabby    coming home as it was day and traffic was thicker i still averaged 80 and got 30 mpg    i couldnt do that with my econobox commuter,blueguydotcom

551,May 2004,i didnt mean heavily modded blown 442s    those are the only ones i remember vividly point is you made a blanket statement that i dont believe was quite accurate you cant even heavily mod a tl because it would shred the trannytires or engine want to get to 60 in 57 how many dropclutch starts does it take before the clutch is burnt out on these modded cars you could dropclutch all day and the dang things would yawn,kdshapiro

553,May 2004,now we can have a car that posts respectable numbers in alot more categories than just 060    wish my pontiac5 got mileage like the above bimmer posts 21 mpg in mostly rural driving    didnt the 70s have a fuel crisis that brought the muscle car era to a screaching halt thats what im hoping isnt going to happen now,fjm1
554,May 2004,it wasnt the fuel crisis so much as it was the smog equipment they had the technology to clean up the exhaust but only at the expense of performance    i had a 77 ford with a 302 v8 135 horsepower two barrel carb gobs of torque but ran out of breath fast    regards  kyfdx  moderator    prices paid lease questions suvs,kyfdx

558,May 2004,all g owners complaining about gas mileage  part of the solution is a modified upper intake plenum available from two compaines charging about 395 for them look at the stock one  remove the engine cover  and see the slope in the front  the front cylinders are choking for air becasue the 350z was desiged with such a huge slant nose  same motor in our car with same flawthis is not a normal mod this fixes a flaw and allows for a proven better distibution of air flow    in an hour and a half it took to install the plenum and some break in miles i went from 270 miles per tank to 430 per tank on highways tripsthis is with another person and weekend luggage while driving fast the entire time i can get from philly to raleigh nc without stopping now also the 20 hp increase and significantly better overall responsiveness throughout the rev range are a huge bonus    to stay on topic any of you other sedan owners pushing 300 hp with 10001200 bucks in minor modifications,chrisboth

561,May 2004,to stay on topic any of you other sedan owners pushing 300 hp with 10001200 bucks in minor modifications    1 the saab guys    2 i flatly dont beleive a plenium upgrade will increase power and economy that much theres just no way the car can produce 260hp at high rpm and be restricted enough to suffer when puttering along on the highway    dave    dave,dhanley
562,May 2004,crawfordzcom has the plenum for 395 kinetix makes a plastic one that has had some issues for about the same price crawford takes a nissan plenum takes the top off and welds on sheet metal to make a new shape on the g forum i frequent with 3500 members there is an absolute consensus that this is the besst bang for buck mod out there for the vq this is not a bolt on honda honda toy this is a fundamental change for the better breathing ability this car should have in the first place if not for the shape of the z hood for which this iteration of the vq is designed have you bud call and chat with doug at crawford and hell be on board tuning like the rest of us who find that those z nuts do all the testing and tuning work to our benefit this motor can easily produce 300hp without spending much cash or making a ton of noise    at atco raceway when 300 zs and gs from several forums got together i raced a coupe with 20 more hp out of the showroom i have just the plenum and a lightweight pulley he got a 147  94 in the 14 at 59 degrees with 39 humidity he has a 6 speed and lauched rather well i have an auto and ran a 142 at 97 other sedan autos were running 15s and even a 16    as for the saabs yes that is a great mod car if you dont mind cranking up the turbo boost  same with audi 18sbut who wants to buy a new turbotalking to a na freak here,chrisboth
563,May 2004,uh oh self proclaimed member of the 300 hp club  kidding aside thanks for the info    i dont want to speak for dave but i think the point was that just a plenum is not going to get a pontiac5 sedan owner 40hp 260 vs 300 id be skeptical that your setup is at 300 close maybe but the vq aint like uncorking some v8 where minor boltons yield staggering s    i would say that 1015 whp is a reasonable claim wont catch me tinkering under the hood until the warranty expires 260 hp is still plenty fast for me,fjm1
564,May 2004,i have no idea what my hp is but i doubt the plenum is worth 40 too how about 20 is what we g guys expect that plus the pulley plus a modified air intake and a grounding kit is what gets you to about 300 or so hell the 350z weight in about 300 less than my car  they run about 144 stock auto with 287 hp so what does a faster heavier car have on the same track same dayyour guess is as good as mine but if i were betting id say more than 287 baby    ps the video of this race of me vs the g coupe left the guy holding the camera audibly gasping as i pulled on the coupe as my car hit second he was right there after second gear he was 5 lengths behind  and he has a six speed with 280 stock and was running a pop dodge and z intake while not good for 40 hp  this is worthwhile beyond the  paid for it and the results dont lie  email me and i can link you to the discussions the v8 thing is true but dont let your past experience detract you from recognizing that if 2 cylinders of the six are choked for air as they are stock that the modification will help in a significant wayagain  this is not a tin can toy for a hyundai  this is an engine design mod,chrisboth
565,May 2004,i am assuming that by doing the mod you have essentially voided your powertrain warranty rightor is this something that nissan endorses,speedracer3
566,May 2004,i do not believe one can make this type change and not void the warranty,kdshapiro
567,May 2004,endorsing is a far cry from denying warranty service they dont need to endorse it to be legally inclined to fix my car if something breaks and that specific mods didnt cause the problem    ive been down a long winding road of discovery since i bought this thing and i felt the same way as you about modding before hell ive owned 5 japanse cars and until now the biggst mod i ever made was putting in speakers that didnt sucki am not into stickers or racing on the street or being seen and heard  its about engineering design funtionality and making the 35k i paid for my car pay off in tinkering and improvements that dont hurt the car fun i want to own this thing for 200k miles or 10 years which ever comes first 10 years is looking good    why would a better air intake manifold setup hurt the car if the intake plenum itself goes then you get a new one from dougand the only ones to go have been covered by him even though they were all fi induced blowouts of the plenum at the weld points  yer talking 450 hp cars here    given that you have effectively improved the car lets hope you didnt drop any bolts or dirt into the intake runners if the day you put the plenum on the car doesnt work becasue you didnt install it correctly  youre on your own but if you put the plenum on and there is a problem with your air flow sensor or the exhaust manifold cracks  well they would have to prove that your mod casued the problem casue and effect are hard for them to come up with in the most clear cut cases the mm act is a good one to get to know it puts the burden of proof on the dealer proven effective mods that dont harm the engine from reputable race teams or proven mod experts is harmless fun to me is there risk  sure but a better design like a plenum that offers better airflow and less air fuel ratio differential for each cylinder or more even distribution of the same air is not going to casue you any problems dont take my word for it call doug or think physics this is no where near the modification level of a forced induction system or something that makes the engine work hotter faster morethis makes it work more efficiently with the existing conditions  ala the better gas mileage    adding 40 hp tp this car is not going to hurt it one iota studying the vq for the last few months while researching the viability of lightweight underrive crank pulley i learned that the vq may be the most naturally balanced and most durable engine ever built with 6 holes from the cylinder bank angle to the internal balancing to the tranny that handles 340hp in a v8 platform from the qit all adds up to me no longer worrying about things that wont hurt my engine the worst thing i ever did was a cold air intake and i may put that back on if my girlfriend stops driving it,chrisboth
568,May 2004,kd  well if it was done with nismo parts and done at a nissan sanctioned facility you would be ok    chris  youd be surprised how manufacturers find any excuse to strip you of your warranty sometimes any mod weather related to the warranty repair or not is enough for them to deny you warranty coverage you shouldnt have a problem with the vq because it is a very sturdy engine but just in case be prepared to fight if you go to your infiniti dealership for warranty repair that relates to engine or tranny,speedracer3
569,May 2004,my dealer actually installed the crank pulley for me there has never been a case where a pulley casued a vq motor to fail    when i show up at the dealer the techs come running to see what iv been working on and many are incorporating my mods into thier own nissan and gs many dealers sell the pulley and many have installed the plenum not mine some infiniti dealership will give you a hard time as they are not mod friendlya hard time is easliy overcome with knowledge about your rights as a consumer i get bs from service providers all the time about things they think they cant do a little knowledge always overcomes ignorance and people looking for an excuse to not work or cover the warranty,chrisboth
570,May 2004,if you put a nismo cold air induction system on and then drive into enough water to hydrolock  you will not be covered the law should be applied consistently regardless of the manufacturer i assure you infiniti wont take on the liablity of all the people driving in fla during the summer rain with a cai on nismo or not nismo does not have to make the aftermarket part to make you feel betteryour warrantly applies in the same manner under the same law no matter what is installed by whoever,chrisboth

573,June 2004,yeah in the sf bay area the flashy cars are everywhere i get excited when i see a lamborghini but not much else as for sedans i guess it really has to do with preference i personally think the head turners that you mention such as the mazda and bug look pretty dumb and id rather have a more normal looking car not bland though like a volkswagen or honda but a bit more sporty like the pontiac5 or bmw bmw are everywhere but i feel the 330 with zhp makes it look a bit different with a different front bumper and wheels that make the car look better maybe people dont even notice those subtle differences though unfortunately i dont like the looks of the pontiac5 so im stuck lusting after the bmw which you see everywhere    i guess im just saying that i dont think the bmw looks so boringexcept that many people have them it certainly wont make you look old just my opinion    its probably hard to make flashy on a budget and still appeal to a high  of peoplewithout looking ghetto or tacky bland sells,jazevedo
574,June 2004,four seat headturners exist in other classes mazda mazda volkswagen bug convertible bmw mini cooper dodge dodge    to each his own only the mazda to me is a head turner and it has far less usable space than the bland tl pontiac5 and 3 series guess im weird as i think the tl g and 3 are sexy and classy while the other cars mentioned are showy donothings    it seems there is a need for a class of automobile in the 35k range that fulfils all of the needs of the nearluxury buyer with kids  plus has headturning appeal    beauty is in the eye of the beholder unless youre looking to buy a car that other people approve ofwhich is ultraweird,blueguydotcom
575,June 2004,the tl infiniti pontiac5 infiniti coupe bmw have bland common body styles and interiors they are not headturners     i had those same thoughts i traded in a 99 navy blue chevrolet for my 04 cadillac cts because i needed something a bit more practical the cts is more of a head turner then most of the others i was considering the styling certainly isnt bland anyway its a great handling car as wellit gives me some of the same driving enjoyment i had with the chevrolet,scott1
576,June 2004,the cts is more of a head turner then most of the others i was considering    unfortunately its a head turner in the negative sense of the word i think its still plain ugly    to be a head turner it still has to be an exotic otherwise the car is stuck in a morass of cars all trying to be head turners where no one car really stands out,kdshapiro
577,June 2004,unfortunately its a head turner in the negative sense of the word    speak for yourself sold 50k units last year 25k thru may this year    of course the styling of the cts is love it or hate it more people love it right now than hate it    i think cadillac did what they had to do with the bold style of the cts they knew they couldnt make it look like a 3 series wannabe so they went with a completely different look the sales figures prove there was a market outside of the classic look of the 3,jjm
578,June 2004,while the caddy may not turn heads for the same reasons it is turing heads the ctsv is phat and i applaud caddy for going against the grain with the cts sytle theme the angular design is bold and not hard to like imo that style is selling in many iterations and will be with us for a while,chrisboth
579,June 2004,the ctsv is phat and i applaud caddy for going against the grain with the cts sytle theme    its still ugly and that has nothing to do with sales look at hyundai to prove that point i would rather have a new 3 series with the 333hp turbo than a ctsv any day i can just imagine my car with 333hp yummy maybe bmw will even offer up an lsd,kdshapiro

581,June 2004,the cover photo of cds march 2004 comparison says it all     they all look like japanese economy cars cut from the same basic bland mold nothing special  you see them everywhere and everyone is driving one anyone of them could be a korean auto a deckedout honda or toyota or  is yugo back with a new sedan    the desert backdrop is appropriate    httpwwwcaranddrivercomarticleaspsectionid15article id7785pagenumbesubaru,rckyvntr

583,June 2004,spend sometime in europe and amerasian sports sedans stand out from the typical european styling    at least folks there take badges off cars because they dont want to draw attention,jmess
584,June 2004,i like the cts approach the dodge fighter inspired look i think its too tall though disproportionate dont you think they would have nailed it with a little less height the tail is chunky and the tail lights overpowering    the dodge look personified is the cadillac cien its awesome they get an a with this baby auto designers take note this one shows real talent no lamborghini or ferrari has anything on this masterpiece of course im talking only about exterior styling too bad well probably never see it released btw would have given it an a if not for once again the stark blocky rear which seems to afflict most cars today    httpwwwedmundscomnewsconceptcarspotlightarticles51600ar     ticlehtml,designman
585,June 2004,it gets a kinda okay if you take the concept of styling and moving forward bmw did a better job in their 57 series than caddy did with this of course its a prototype but im not a fan of bold angular styling thats why i like the new 57 series,kdshapiro
586,June 2004,i think caddy is going in the right direction seems they are well on their way to proving they can morph into something that was unexpected from them they are pulling off change if they refine and develop some stamina in this direction they should do fine on the other hand the bmw story is developing into one of recovery,designman
587,June 2004,look at hyundai to prove that point i would rather have a new 3 series with the 333hp turbo than a ctsv any day i can just imagine my car with 333hp yummy maybe bmw will even offer up an lsd     i think you prove my point once hyundia got some itilian designers the cars looked better not g level but thats tuff to beat and sales are better than ever    less subjectively 333 hp is heavy duty but a turbo is just against my grain 400 hp in the caddy for 45 or so is tuff to beat especially as na format when will this hit the shelves kd i hear the older 30 is going to be the only option for a couple years by then theyll all have 350 hp options hell the g is only 3540 hp away from that in 05 anywaywith more na refinements to come im sure,chrisboth
588,June 2004,wow    of course its a prototype but im not a fan of bold angular styling thats why i like the new 57 series     what do you call those bangle lines that arent really doing anything but creating angles and seeming so bold,chrisboth
589,June 2004,the dodge look personified is the cadillac cien its awesome    httpwwwedmundscomnewsconceptcarspotlightarticles51600ar     ticlehtml    wow a quintessential head turner do they make a 35k 22 seater stripped version    ps  the cts does stand out in terms of body style,rckyvntr
590,June 2004,i think you prove my point once hyundia got some itilian designers the cars looked better not g level but thats tuff to beat and sales are better than ever    their cars are still ugly    re the ctsv different strokes for different folks yes they win bragging rights as eclipsing the japanese in hp per dollar but well have to see how they are in the real world wont we    bmw do not have sharp angular styling,kdshapiro
591,June 2004,bold styling can be an advantage or a curse take for example nissan and bmw    bmw their designs were generally appealing and handsome enter bangle now their designs are so bold that you either love them or hate them which will probably drive some loyal folks away imo this is an example of the wrong kind of bold design    nissan especially in the 90s their cars so bland and unappeling that honda and toyota nearly ate nissan for lunch enter renault yeah the french influence made for some wacky designs but then again nissan needed to take chance to get back in the game bold design along with good product has paid off for nissan,speedracer3
592,June 2004,do you want to turn heads merely because of looks cars like cts or new hemi 300c or because people in the know know what a car can do bmw or bmw ill take the latter over the former any time substance over style,riez

598,June 2004,for others like me it is important to at least ask why cant i have it all    one can have it all but again its about how you view it not how others do most people say the ferrari modena is a great looking car or the lambo cars are hot to me theyre pretty bland id probably love a drive in one but its not my kind of car    so again it seems it should go back to what you find to be be good looking fun to drive and exciting i cant grasp how the opinions of others should make a shred of difference in the purchase of a car what others think of my car is the least important aspect of my car ownership experience,blueguydotcom
599,June 2004,ps  the cts does stand out in terms of body style      i have to agree but style is only part of the reason i went with a cts the mercedes benz c class was too small i drove an e320 which was a very comfortable size and rode nice and smooth it was also 58000 as opposed to the 43000 of my cts and didnt have the acceleration that the cts has what really scared me off of the e class was reading the horror stories about reliabilty over on the mercedes benz forum     i also checked out the lexusfirst the esa very quiet and refined car but with no pretentions to sports car handling and the rather blah looks of a toyota and even the ls the ls is a beautiful automobile with a silky smooth engine and drivetrain but again its styling is rather blandand it costs 58000       the bmw 3 series was a smooth refined car  but again a bit cdodgeped for my tastes       the cts fit the bill best for what i was looking for head turning style first class sport sedan handling a smooth refined engine and drive train and a quiet comfortable interior and ride the fact that there are lots more cadillac dealers in my area then mercedes benz bmw and lexus dealers combined didnt hurt either,scott1
600,June 2004,i agree with your assessment of caddys art  science theme a little less height would make the cars proportions much better    i also think the corner angles are a little too sharp just a minor roundingsoftening of the corner lines would have done the trick imo    the cien is a beautiful car v12 750hp decent gas mileage due to dod whats not to like if it makes it to production itll certainly spank bmw 760i which itself is a wonderful car    i applaud cadillac and nisssan for being bold and original in their styling even if it doesnt quite work its a design that can be improved on and makes a striking contrast to what is out there today    i feel bmw tried to be bold and certain elements of bangles styling work well but there seems to be no overall theme to bangles designs the bangle butt looks like its just been slapped on in darker colors bangles front and sides look good in lighter colors bangles front and sides look disproportionally large    i also dont think bangle was that original the front of the new bmw aside from the dame edna turn signals look very much like pontiacs except that i like the pontiacs proportions better    pontiacs goal was to become a poor mans bmw    first step of gms plan    plant a mole within bmw to make bmw look more like pontiacs    mission accomplished,saugatak

603,June 2004,latest stuff floating around bmw concerns the new 30 used in the upcoming 630i itll produce 250 hp but still the anemic torque rating of 221 or so argh that engine will be in the e90 3 series    word is also coming that a turbo version will be around with 333 hp as the high end 330i before one jumps to an bmw with a v8    turbo if its small low pressure turbo thatll help the torquedeficiency problem of bmw overly praised inline 6    and someone asked about a favorite filmi see too many to ever narrow it down to one if i had to pick 5 the third man once were warriors cool hand luke or butch and sundance or the hustler out of sight and princess bride    rebel without a cause  movie without a plot or decent acting,blueguydotcom

605,June 2004,the mazdaudi is basically a less dressy version of the s40 same basic car for less money with the money saved you could look into some simple mods for the 24 mazda drops into the car i know mazda owners are crazy about tinkering one turbo could make the 3 an insanely fun little carhatch,blueguydotcom

608,June 2004,someone mentioned volvo designed the whips safety device headrest  this made me think of something interested about saab    i read some history of saab several weeks ago and found that certain ideasproducts were created by saab but everyone thought other manufacturers created them saab was the first one to came up with the followings    1 heated seat i thought it was mb or bmw  2 ventilatedcooling seat i thought it was mb  3 whips and headlight wipers     i though it was volvo too    4 etcetc    saab was one of the first car maker to build a production turbo car successfully i am not sure if saab was the first one but they were among the first group    it seems that saab didnt do much in the marketing area to promote its unique features but some carmakers want you to believe they were the pioneer of certain features    a carmaker ford  put a tv commerical several months ago said the cooling seat was one of their innovative ideas interesting,r34

612,June 2004,ive seen a mercedes benz and a lexus split cleanly into two different pieces on the road after the fact of course i dont know what happened to make that happen but these things really depend on the severity of the impact    anyways anyone really know what the engine choices are for the next 3 ive read a 230hp to 250hp 30l and a 260hp to 290hp 35l    i guess theyll be called the 330i and bmw then if true i can see the 330i outselling the bmw by more than 8 to 1 even right now the 325i outsells the 330i by 5 to 1,jrock65
613,June 2004,turbo if its small low pressure turbo thatll help the torquedeficiency problem of bmw overly praised inline 6    short of bumping up displacement or supercharging there isnt a lot that can be done to increase max torque    220ftlb to 230 ftlb sounds about right for a 30l engine,saugatak

617,June 2004,for some reason the german cars have side marker lights on either the body or the side mirror while japanese and american luxury cars generally dont have this feature a few do though i find this feature invaluble when other cars are changing lanes its difficult to see the corner lights in the front of the merging car but if all cars had side maker lights im sure driving would be a bit safer why more cars dont have this inexpensive feature i dont know im actually kinda of suprised that my dads 96 volvo doesnt have this feature,dcwong1
618,June 2004,i just came back from my test drive of the tl and s40  the s40s performance and handling were great fit and  finish were excellent and the seats were very comfortable  the sound system was impressive the seating position seems  much higher than in the tl and the overall ride was more  comfortable than the tl    the tls performance and handling were excellent again fit  and finish was great and seating was comfortable the ride was  a little harsher than the s40 and harsher than my current tl types  the sound system to me was hands down much more impressive than  the volvo the seating was not as comfortable as the s40 but i preferred the seating position over the s40    overall i like the tl much more than the s40 the s40 was lacking in some areas such as very small door pockets for storage and a very  small console and center armrest the s40s door armrests were very narrow when compared to the tl they are both great cars but i definetly prefer the acura,tasdisr

620,June 2004,lenghtwise you are correct the s40 is about 10 inches shorter than  the tl and has 218 hp compared to the tls 270 pricewise by the time  you option the s40 out to be comparable to the tl the sticker price  is about the same the tl is 34650 and the s40 t5 with premium pkgconvenience pkg climate pkg dstc bixenon hlamps and moonroof  is 3506500,tasdisr

628,June 2004, the mercedes benz c class is an entry lux sedan a honda is a compact car weiging less while being smaller and having less equipment smaller engine of course a c class will tdodgeple a honda it weighs as much as a g or more hello a hummer will crush a blazer no one said all cars are equal    you missed the point by a country mile i said that the c or s40 would come out in accident better not one between a cclass and a honda weight has very little to do with how safe the car is going to be tell that all the cops getting killed in their very heavy crown vics how the car is designed is more important than how heavy it is why the h do you think anyone said this was a tank battle who said anything who is going to crush who youre confused     whats the big deal with 65 vs 45 do you really know whats best for engineers designing cars no    youre right i dont butt companies like volvo and mercedes benz and saab do theyve been doing just that for over 40 years 50 in the case of mb and volvo     its easy to make tests have 65 mph as national standard but most cars would be demolished  while our class would benefit the rest of the smaller 75 cars on the market would be scrap after an offset frontal at that speed    sorry but this makes no sense to me problem is youre stuck on that test lab stuff an offset crash isnt the only type of accident you can have    im not knocking the pontiac5 but nissan has been very skimpy with their cars to get them to the market right now and there is no way ill believe that theyre just as safe as volvo saab or mercedes benz…these companies while theyve had their problems in other areas have never compromised on safety now nissan is supposed to have matched them in an area they werent even an expert in during the time where theyre cutting cost at every possible area right gm cars feel solid too doesnt mean they are safe the crashtest failing acura rl feels solid too    m,merc1
629,June 2004,but nissan has been very skimpy with their cars to get them to the market right now and there is no way ill believe that theyre just as safe as volvo saab or mercedes benz    skimpy my  the cars on the line right now have nissan at the height of the industry on just about every front including product quality    profit in an oversupplied industry is just one indication that rushing to market is hogwash the pontiac5 certainly wasnt rushed to market nor was the fx the z or the upcoming m45 you dont own the toughest class for 2 years running and put the competition into a tailspin with rushed to market cars and inferior design    as for safety you know as much as i do about what the g will donada so until we know your speculation is as meaninglss as mine i know marketing wont save you neither will past research by some truly good companies that made safety a priority  typically euro makers if that makes you feel good about paying a premium for a volvo or bmw then pay away,chrisboth

637,July 2004,i think infiniti can really increase sales by selling the g with a 30l engine pontiac0 which already exists in japan for about 2000 less than a pontiac5 in an age of rising gas prices this makes even more sense    the 325i outsells the 330i by almost 5 to 1 what would the 3 series sales be without the 25l option apparently the next c will have 25 30 35 engine choices as well thanks merc1 for this info    of course selling a pontiac0 could hurt infinitis power image    you might argue that its not good to have a pontiac0 while lesser nissan sedans such as the nissan and the nissan have larger 35l v6s then have the 30l option in the nissan and nissan as well    bmw does the same thing they make the 525i even though the 330i exists and the 525i sells wellalmost as well as the 530i    increase brand awareness by catering to a wider market of buyers by offering a pontiac0 these buyers may also trade up as they get older face it infiniti has made great progress in the past couple years but it still has nowhere the brand recognition of bmw mb or lexus of course they should also go more upscale by concentrating on the m sedan and coupe as well as the next q    all the press and buzz and comparisons that bmw makes is with the 330i yet the reality is that the 325i is their bread and butter the pontiac5pontiac0 relationship could be the same    a 230hp pontiac0 w premium package at an msrp of 32k 29k street price should get a lot of people in the door,jrock65

639,July 2004,jrock65 you should look at the epa fuel mileage estimates for the 325i and 330i you might be surprised the 325i really doesnt get you anything in mileage some due to gearing some due to small engine for the weight    i do wish toyotalexus had marketed a barebones is200 with 6speed manual in usa toyota sells it in japan and europe,riez
640,July 2004,blueguy i thnk anyone with a pontiac5 tranny will argue that it is one of the best in the biz    thats the problem with anyone arguing its all personal opinion the bmw steptronic has been lauded for being one of the best in class,kdshapiro
641,July 2004,it gets you more in mileage round town not on the highway cruising at 65 foot lightly on the accelerator i live in an area with total different traffic than you lot of heavy stop and for miles and miles a 325 has better mileage in this type of traffic than a 330,kdshapiro
642,July 2004,having owned a nissan equipped with the vaudi0 and driven many vaudi5s my vote actually goes to the smaller engine the vaudi0 is a lot smoother especially in the higher rpm ranges in terms of bringing a smaller engine size wouldnt bother with a pontiac0 too close to the pontiac5 but a infiniti skyline 250gt would actually be an great entry level infiniti,speedracer3
643,July 2004,kd the steptronic is great at everything but keeping you from owning a dog when you wanted a cat the auto makes an otherwise very strong motor seem less enthusiastic and frankly slow the manual is a very nice compliment to the straight six the auto saps power somehow so while nice and smooth its less than desirable to many who dont want to sacrifice performance because they live in the northeast,chrisboth
644,July 2004,kdshapiro im talking about both city and highway epa estimates the 325i is not fuel efficient of course both a 330i and a 325i will get 0 mpg when stuck in heavy traffic and waiting at stoplights that is the downside to heavy urban traffic and roadway congestion    325i uses a numerically higher final drive than the 330i that impacts rpms in all gears lowering fuel economy,riez
645,July 2004,bmw can market the 525 to people who want a bigger sedan with no concern for speed remember many nonenthusiast will look at bmw for nothing more than status    if the 525 was reduced in size and the 330 was increased than you would be looking at different sales figures for the 525,gpwatfrd
646,July 2004,blueguy i thnk anyone with a pontiac5 tranny will argue that it is one of the best in the biz the lost power for six speed to 5at is minimal as any car ive ever seen stats on take a look at the 3 series drop in times when going auto and then look at 5at the vaugeness is handled by enthusiastic owners and thier easy remedies smooth shifting defined in a tranny built for a much higher power q45 v8      chris take it anyway you want i love nissan they build hearty durable long lasting cars with solid fit and finish same cant be said of bmw but im not real fond of the nissan propensity for eating brakes or the truckish trannies they come with,blueguydotcom
647,July 2004,thats sell quite well they should mod that nissan 25 a bit maybe a low pressure turbo to give it over 200 hp and 200 ftlbs of torque price the g at 25k or so without all the fixings top out at around 32k with moon navi etc itd sell like hotcakes itd be what the g20 never was to infiniti  an entry level car thatll attract droves,blueguydotcom
648,July 2004,i have been looking at the pontiac5 awd sedan and was wondering what kind of gas mileage you can expect  from the car,tasdisr
649,July 2004,a newspaper reporter is looking for someone who bought a luxury car with lots of highend gadgets and ended up either not progdodgeming most of it or having lots of problems getting it to work please respond to jfallonedmundscom by thursday july 8 2004 by 5 pm eastern and be sure to include your daytime phone number and a few words about your vehicle and gadgets    thanks  jeannine fallon  pr director  edmundscom,Sylvia
650,July 2004,they build hearty durable long lasting cars with solid fit and finish same cant be said of bmw    if you insert the words kind of after the word they ill agree with that statement,kdshapiro
651,July 2004,the reason the 325i sells so well compared to the 330i is because the difference in performance is less ddodgeatic than one might expect and the 325i is almost 5000 cheaper    that and the fact that many 325i buyers dont care about speed or performance just the spinning propeller on the hood,fedlawman
652,July 2004,i think its mainly the price    performancewise i think there is a huge difference the 325i might actually be more nimble than the 330i but the power difference feels significant especially with the auto transmission    in a straight line the 325i feels like a 4cylinder honda the 330i can almost keep up with the pontiac5s and tls out there    but apparently most 3 series buyers would rather be in a relatively sluggish 35k vehicle keep the 5k and have the propeller on the hood,jrock65
653,July 2004,the engine performance difference between the 30 and 25 is pretty extreme imho i flat out would not purchase a 325ithere wasnt a noticeable jump in power from my 18t an extra 10k for rwd no thanks id rather have the cheaper but just as quick feeling acura over the 325i  more entertaining engine better tranny more features and bulletproof for 30k the 325 should have more going for it than handling,blueguydotcom
654,July 2004,for 30k the 325 should have more going for it than handling    it does    propeller on the hood,saugatak
655,July 2004,ah but the propeller on the hood signifies a common theme in bmw lineup of vehicles quality performance oriented drivers automobiles its irrelevant whether you want to acknowledge that or not people understand this about bmw    i laugh everytime some says the propellor on the hood because it ignores the obvious that people want what they want and it seems those comments are all about jealousy its not my place to comment because someone buys an 3000 armani suit for the name or a propeller on the hood for the emblem obviously the name armani and the propeller on the hood means something to the buyer,kdshapiro
656,July 2004,im sorry but 325 is not performance oriented vehicle just bacouse bmw makes bmw and bmw it does not mean that 325 and 525both account for more than 50 of sedan sales are performance oriented acura makes nsx which is arguably better performance car than bmw and its 15 years old but it does not make tl or acura more performance oriented,pg48477
657,July 2004,nothing really to be jealous about a 35000 3 series bimmer please    i do agree with you that there is nothing wrong with buying a car just for its name people buy things for different reasons    that still doesnt change the observations of many on this board that many 3 series buyers principal reason for getting one is for the badge again there is nothing wrong with this    almost by default the regular posters who own a 3 is not in the above category    anyways it seems that the next generation 330i will have 258hp221 torque 30l not sure what the 325i will have but itll probably have at least 210hp that should make its performance a bit more lively,jrock65
658,July 2004,its irrelevant whether you want to acknowledge that or not people understand this about bmw    i dont think all the housewives driving 325s in northern nj understand this about bmw i do think they understand the meaning of the propeller on the hood,saugatak

662,August 2004,i posted this elsewhere but i want to get some additional feedback       i looked today at a 2002 mb c320 sedan it looks like i could get it for around 25k which seems to be a dang good price based on what i got from nada based on the vin they had it booked at 29625  retail  and 25775  tradein before i do anything nuts i thought id ask a few questions       1 the car has 27000 miles on it so it still has a ways to go on the warranty anyone have any experience with mb dealerships on how willing they are are to honor warranty issues from second or third owners of the vehicle    2 there seem to be lots of questions about quality on this board i know its annoying when a quality vehicle gives you grief but it also sounds like the vehicles under warranty are getting problems fixed without too much trouble am i right or am i missing something    3 i gotta know more about the cell phone thing my guess is that it will only work with a specific mb approved cell phone provider right theres no way to get my us cellular number to work with this thing is there    4 any other advice from those of you who have bought a used mb cclass vehicle    thanks for your help    peter,Weazell
663,August 2004,ill be interested in hearing the answers to your questions    rumour has it that mb will be bringing the e320 over with the turbodiesel and having driven a number of recent rental diesel vehicles in europe im intrigued,cdnpinhead
664,August 2004,rumour has it that mb will be bringing the e320 over with the turbodiesel    its not a rumour i think theyre already selling them in fact,dhanley
665,August 2004,rumour has it that mb will be bringing the e320 over with the turbodiesel    i dont think its a rumor edmunds got one tested already if im not mistaken    peter i cant tell you much regarding the warranty issues on 2nd owners but my parents always have at least one merc in their garage and everytime it has problems they get fixed w barely any questions just a reminder mercedes benz are just like other german cars expect some minor problems including electrical issues,m4d_cow
666,August 2004,greetings all i have been following this board for over a year and have found the discussions both interesting and hondaful this fall i intend to purchase either a new 05 240 elegance or bmw 325i i have only owned and driven toyota in the past on average keeping them 12 yearsthey have only ever been great cars in terms of reliability they are my standard but im ready to try something more upscale now and after a fair amount of research it has come down to the 2 fine cars mentioned above i intend to keep my next car for 10 years i will only put lowcity mileage on it will get the extended warranty and expect to pay it off within 1 year     my first choice or the choice of my heart would be the 240 but i am concerned about the recent consumer reports ratings of the car i know that the 01 and 02 years are of greater concern on this how has the reliability been for those who bought 03 and 04 model years     i guess my close 2nd choice or the choice of my head would be the bmw its a little more sports sedan im more of a touring sedan type myselfand it has very high ratings from most automotive sources at any rate i would appreciate your thoughts thank you    b,bmbmw
667,August 2004,most auto magazines make their reviews based on handling and performance or at least more into the performance factor  ive heard of quite a number of people complaining about the pre04 cclass seats being uncomfy on longer trips but i heard they fixed it since the 04 model  reliability isnt far from bmw which in this case if you drive only nonpermissible content removed cars so far is gonna be a pain in the butt if you wanna keep it for 10 years  but even if youre more into touring the bmw is still a fine choice just a bit less comfy than the mercedes benz in the ride department  in any case id say take a test drive before you decide,m4d_cow
668,August 2004,i tend to think reliability is overblownyes a toyota may be more reliable than either of these two carsbut it also might not be the reality of it is that the vast majority of cars out there and probably all the ones in this topic are within a statistical deviation of each other so just buy what you like and gets you the most bang for your buck    theres cars out there that are cool enough that i almost wish my bmw would give me an excuse to trade it    i really like the cclass overall if the c230 had just a little bit more oomph    dave,dhanley
669,August 2004,get the c32 amgmy friend has one and it has some oomph to it,billyperks
670,August 2004,from anecdotal evidence i would say the bmw will be cheaper to maintain than the mercedes benz if you keep it for ten years resale isnt that important but if you do happen to get rid of it earlier the 3series will hold its value better than the cclass    something that might sway you bmw will soon be offering manufacturer extended warranties that bump the coverage to 6ysubaru00k miles and you can also extend the free maintenance coverage to match that time period the extended warranty is 2249 and the extended maintenance plan is 995    except for future price increases you can buy that coverage for the same price at any time before your original warranty and maintenance plan run out    i wouldnt discount the bmw just because you are a touring type of person just stay away from the sport package one of the 3series strengths is how well it combines handling with a good ride    regards  kyfdx  moderator    prices paid lease questions suvs,kyfdx
671,August 2004,i purchased a 2002 c320 in december 2003 and also got a great deal paid about 28k and this one was fully loaded with the cd changer phone cradle heated seats etc best things was it only had 10k miles on it couldnt believe it    1 service with mercedes benz mercedes benz has been great the car is still under warranty and coverage has never been an issue even though i am not the original owner i have 20k miles on it now and still have till 2006 or 34k more miles to go to the warranty and regular maintenanceoil changestire rotation are all free    2 i have taken the car in for a a few things and they have gone above and beyond the cupolder has chrome button marked push that was chipping so they replaced it instrument had a smudle so they replaced it spare tire cover plastic handle was broke so they replaced it only problem i have had is there was a whining noise when i would make a turn and turns out it was the power steering they replaced the power steering pump best thing is they also give you a free rental car while your car is being serviced    3 i have the phone cradle for a motorola volvo i was thrilled when i got the car because i already had a volvo but then i found out that it has to be a mercedes benz mercedes benz volvo you know its a contract between mb and motorola so they have to get you somehow i found the phone on ebay for about 200 and its been worth every penny i have service through verizon and live in ca love being able to answer the phone handsfree through the radio speakers and dial through the number pad on the radio    4 bottom line i love the car had it for 7 months now and dont regret buying it what i can recommend is that while its under warranty take advantage of fixing any problem no matter how small ive always driven honda or nissan but this car is a lot of luxury in a compact affordable package,oneandonly1
672,August 2004,thanks for all the great feedback i just keep getting more and more excited about the prospect of owning this car i hope to nail things down this weekend    ive already had a great experience with mb customer service i called our local dealership to ask a couple of questions  including whether or not they might be able to provide me with information about the service record not only were they willing to do that even though i wouldnt be buying the car from them but they faxed it over to me although there have been about a dozen things done to the car over the last year all were done under warranty and all but one were more cosmetic than anything else the one thing that looked kinda major was something labeled rubber mount torsion bar im going to give them a call to find out a bit more but i suspect it wont keep me from moving ahead with the purchase assuming i can bring the price down just a bit more    thanks again,Weazell
673,August 2004,the more systems a things has the more potential for problemsissues so mercedes benz bmw and etc tend to have a lot of features and gadgets that could have issues over time some makers like lexus seem to be able to get more things right the first time but is far from perfect    my uncle had to special order his toyota to get one without electric windows he figured he would have the car for a long time and it was one less thing that could break,jmess
674,August 2004,was really interested in a tl did the test drive etc until by chance i visited the local saab dealer they were offering a leftover 2003 95 aero with every option imaginable for 32 color is metallic green with gray interior had 100 miles on it with plastic still on the seats etc    to make a long story short and after a lot of haggling i ended up buying this car for 27500  tax i test drove this car the same day as the tl and i honestly loved both cars equally apples and oranges i couldnt justify spending the extra 2500 minimum to get the tl in other words the tl didnt blow me away to the point where i was saying this is the car i must own i am on a tight budget so this figure was ideally the amount that i wanted to spend on a car yes it is an 03 not an 04 but at that price i couldnt turn it down    will pick up the car this monday august 6 and i hope this will be the beginning of a new long and fruitful relationship with saab    i know i would have loved the tl as well but for this time around i am going swedish not japanese i am trading in my 98 eclipse gst with 136k miles i will miss my little eclipse,chalkpie
675,August 2004,jmess you wrote some makers like lexus seem to be able to get more things right the first time but is far from perfect    wife and i have now put on about 30000 miles in our lexuss not a single problem nothing nada zip in the first 40000 miles my wifes former 323ia had various issues like with sunroof seats and cd player    hoping they are like our former 1996 g20ts over 80000 miles and never a single problem,riez
676,August 2004,my wife and i just got back back this enjoyable event    i drove a lexus gs430 mb s430 infiniti pontiac5 lexus lexus bmw 330i lexus ls430 acura tl lexus es330    impressions    gs430  good power and good handling nice but outdated interior layoutdesign cd changer in glovebox poorly designed center consolestorage etc this car needs to be restyled inside and out    s430  nice power and surprisingly good handling for such a large carthis car really attacked the corners interior was high class but somewhat colduninviting with some quirky ergonomics    pontiac5  best drive of the bunch brakes very grabby took some finesse but wonderful power exhaust note and cornering interior layoutquality is this cars achilles heel it was a 2004    lexus  not as hard edged as i remember light and nimble handling decent power yet at a disadvantage vs competition interior looked and felt cdodgeped uninviting and lowrent well my wife liked the speedometer    330i  more powerful than lexus but softer around the edges handling and drivetrain wise slightly more mush in the steering suspension and throttle response interior a step or two up from lexus and pontiac5 but still looked and felt dated and a little cheap    ls430  the car id choose if i had to commute in traffic or took a lot of trips plush warm and inviting interior suede headliner big comfy seats everything softtouch nice straightline power but a pig in the twisties    tl  the car id choose if i had to commute in traffic or took a lot of trips but only had 30k to spend basically felt like a lowerrent ls430nice power and plush modern interior but soft driving dynamics    es330  my wife drove this one she liked it i didnt a toyota dressed in lexus clothing    conclusions if someone could build a 30k ish car that drivessounds like the pontiac5 and has the interior of the tl theyd get my money    ps the longest line was for the cadillac xlr its kinda ugly but it goes like heck sounds awesome and corners on rails,fedlawman
677,August 2004,nice writeup if i could be driving an ls430 i would be driving a 745 if my budget was an absolute 30k it would be a loaded honda i would rather drive a loaded honda than a stripper 325 if i had 40k the 3 series performance package,kdshapiro
678,August 2004,you should seriously consider lexus if longterm reliability is a concern,ponytrekker
679,August 2004,official photos of the next 3 have been released less controversial looking than the 5 or the 7 and has a little more pizzaz than the current 3 not what evokes wow beautiful or handsome but not bad either    but im not a big fan of the new interior seems pretty bland there seems to be both a idrive version and a nonidrive version at least for euro models    of course ill have to reserve final judgment until i actually see the car and sit in it,jrock65
680,August 2004,not what evokes wow beautiful or handsome but not bad either    its a much more modern handsomeathletic design than the now date 6 year old 3 series i think theyll be gorgeous in person,kdshapiro
681,August 2004,because the color of the car in the pics makes it look downright bland,blueguydotcom
682,August 2004,jrock    do you have any links to the pictures of the new 3series,lexusjunkie
683,August 2004,look on the 2006 bmw 3 series board for links to pics,kdshapiro
684,August 2004,did you have a chance to drive a cadillac cts or the new sts    i think the cts with the new 36 is a better choice than the pontiac5 if they were equal in price but a similarly equipped to the teeth pontiac5 is like 5k less than the cts which runs into the 40s    it would be intersting to see how the sts does against the 430 aswell,exalteddragon1
685,August 2004,did you check the rear end looking like a cheap nissan or honda rear end design,m4d_cow
686,August 2004,the xlr was the only cadillac there i would have liked to have seendriven the new sts    as for the cts they could put a ford power unit in it and it would still be ugly to me,fedlawman
687,August 2004,i have been lurking in vain for the answer to my questions i would appreciate some feedback if possible i live in colorado and need to know if there are any other coloradans or people that have driven i70 over eisenhower tunnel in a 325i loaded with people 10000 ft up i used to have a honda prelude w a power to weight ratio of 1hp to 193 lbs and the 325i has a 163 power to weight i would be luggin extra weight due to 4 people the honda did just fine if you dipped into the power band a little bit the honda was geared a little on the high side like the 325i relative to their respective competitors id like to buy new and the 325i is the most i can afford mention a new 330 and just break out the drool cup im looking at this being a 100k car thats why i am not looking at a used 330i    somehow id feel cheated if i spent all that money and couldnt get up the hill,kasperghost
688,August 2004,but the bmw has plenty of torque and horsepower for any highspeed driving you need to do if your prelude could handle it you have nothing to worry about with 325i    regards  kyfdx  moderator    prices paid lease questions suvs,kyfdx
689,August 2004,check out the 05 subi subaru gt you get awd for the co winters and a turbo to give you the high altitude performance you are looking for,jmess
690,August 2004,i agree that the subaru would have the power especially with the turbo giving such outstanding high altitude performance i read the first drive on the front page of edmunds and wasnt impressed with the engine review i drove the 325 the other day and be still my beating no pounding heart it drives like people say it does im not too worried about the winters we get the most sunshine out of any magor city in the us all things being equal i want the bmw my only other contender is the tl but 270 out of a fwd    thanks for any input,kasperghost
691,August 2004,well i bet most people have been waiting forever for the softer leather since imo the current leather is darn stiffhard and the harsh ride just makes it worse,m4d_cow
692,August 2004,any of you guys spent time behind the wheel of an volvor    i sat in one at the autoshow and thought nice interior too bad its a boat i didnt think it was a 060 in 54 and 65mpg slalom car    dave,dhanley
693,September 2004,volvor is a boat it may go fast but it doesnt like it the turbo lag is impressive the brakes felt mushy it is very quiet good but it makes it hard to shift bad i actually got quite sea sick driving it the radio designer should be shot still it is pretty you wife with like it it is safe and resell is good you just will hate it until you resell it save 10 grand and look at the subaru subaru gt if you want performance or the acura tl if you want comfort both are good balanced players in power verses comfort,minnehaha
694,September 2004,a boat i havent heard that one yet it is fast handles well and is more comfortable than the subaru or tl both are very good but to call the volvor a boat is crazy,volvodan1
695,September 2004,minnehaha the subaru gt is a fine car especially going in a straight line on the highway where it reaches extralegal speeds in no time and feels good doing it significant body roll and understeer greatly reduces the fun factor for me but it is a car i might recommend as a comfortable family hauler    the volvo volvorv70r however is in a different class altogether faster way more stable feels lighter much more chevrolet very fun to drive in addition the exterior and interior aesthetic design as well as the quality of the interior materials particularly the leather are in another league,ephemere
696,September 2004,enjoy the banter and wouldnt want to take you folks off the track of approved vehicles but the volvor is a very nice package indeed i bought an 04 volvo in july a dog by comparison but drove the r series many times for comparison it flies and has a nicer interior vs the subaru to boot if it hadnt been for the narrow seats my problem with a cracked spine i would have plumped for it    for the record we also owned a 325 and currently have a c320 both are different from the volvor but i sure wouldnt describe the latter as a boat    john,johncdnrockies
697,September 2004,not a boat i say though the extremely complicated audio controls really turn me off kinda like volvo version of idrive  its a decent handler though no match to beemers or audi,m4d_cow
698,September 2004,if you are gonna call these boats then they are nice speed boats  the interiors are great for these 2 models they are equal to the audi  audi audis and better than the corresponding bmw and mb sedans    i like these cars and the volvo although i will probably never buy a volvo due to the crappy treatment i got from a dealer in hyundai monica a few years back i might eat my words when the volvo with v8 comes out    i do question the lighter feel and nimbler handling perception versus the subaru the subaru is lighter by 300 lbs they are way stable though and track turns well but nimble is not in volvo dna the steering feel in a subaru is more precise imho good brakes are standard for volvo though comparing to the mercedes benz or bmw in the price range for snow duty i would get the volvo    comparing it to the subaru gt if you got the extra dough the volvo is awesome,buddhabman
699,September 2004,i think volvo did something good to have volvor and the new s40 esp t5    for the other swedan car maker saab they need to work harder many people think that their technology is outdated and the 93 interior not not good    well i looked at the 2006 audi report in edmunds yesterday it mentioned that audi added twin balance shafts that spin at twice the engine speed to audi to minimize vibration    balance shafts  sounds mazdar i checked both my 2001 93  95 owners manuals and found that both cars were equipped with 2 balance shafts at that time i am not sure when saab put those in their cars    i remembered i asked an audi salesperson whether the auto tranny of an audi can learn the drivers driving style adaptive transmission  and he told me no    i think saab has some nice and unique features that they didnt mention to people not that many people know saab came up the idea of headlight wipers heated seats etc the marketing dept should be responsible for that    now 93 is more mainsteam maybe most people like it better than the old one i missed the hatch it needs something more than 210hp saab should create something like the viggen with awd for the 93 i heard there will be a 93 sport hatch but awd may not be an option,r34
700,September 2004,hmmthat was how i felt about the 900 i used to have that car had lots of great features with a few glaring oversightsshortcomings i also had the bmw then which had fewer gee neat features and less utility  hatch interior room  but no real shortcomings i cared about for example the bmw engine didnt have that hammeryouinto the seat torque blast with that cool motorcycle sound but it didnt have the turbo lag either the saab was sort of a headache and i chose to keep the bmw but i miss that car in general    i recently seriously considered getting either a 93 or a 95 i really like them both but each had something that made me say wait although i was contemplating pulling the trigger in each case once with a 95 aero  used 3000 miles  and the other time with a new arc both manual transmission the 95s bane was handlingturbo lag and the 93s was the el cheapo gm interior both could be fixed of course i think simply sticking the ecotec in the 95 would improve it a lot its a lighter smaller engine  for better weight distribution with less turbo lag the ecotec is also smoother another thing that irked me is the nature of the turbo with stick you have to shift really fast or boost is largely lost between shifts its find if youre driving all out but not so great for maneuvers in traffic sort of the opposite of the pontiac my cousin wants me to get even with my bmw i can start moving without using the gas just easing in the clutch while i felt quite choppy in both the saabs when starting off    the lack of the hatch also miffed me    still id rather have a car i really like with a few bugs than a car that is mostly reliable kind of like dating the awesome girl with a few issues vs miss boring and theres something about the saab that i at least want to like    the new s40 really intrigues me it seems to have impressive environmental credentials which i know a lot of you probably dont care about that much so ill shut up about that    dave,dhanley
701,September 2004,saab 93 isnt bad actually ive driven one and id say its equal to volvos in handling im not a fan of hatchbacks so i surely wont miss it the only problem is im kinda concerned about the reliability  the new s40 is a great handler better than any other volvos seems like its time for them to start competing w the germans  but the problem is its unusually shaped its skinnynarrow and tall and the leather seats are overly firm for my taste,m4d_cow
702,September 2004,i always thought that by seating in the car in the showroom you can only say how comfortable the interior is you on the other hand managed to get how the car performs that is impressive    as for me i think that volvor has the most comfortable seats of any vehicles i had a chance to drive im not to crazy about the looks in and out but this car has so much to offer that i will consider buying it anyway it performs just as good and in many cases better than cars discussed on this board handling on the same page as 330 with performance package and at the same time if you switch suspension to comfort its as soft as a lexus not only it handles grate it also give you grate acceleration 060 in 55 and almost no turbo lag,pg48477
703,September 2004,i always thought that by seating in the car in the showroom you can only say how comfortable the interior is you on the other hand managed to get how the car performs that is impressive    where did i do that,dhanley
704,September 2004,i sat in one at the autoshow and thought nice interior too bad its a boat i didnt think it was a 060 in 54 and 65mpg slalom car     did not you call it a boat its not a full size vehicle and you did like the interior so i guess boat would refer to the way the car feel on the road,pg48477
705,September 2004,i thought i made it clear that i guessed that but learned otherwise from sources id quoted    you know like how i might assume a ferrari is fast although ive never driven one volvo has a rep and a lot of reviews    i didnt say anything that implied in any way that i could tell how it drives by sitting it it it might be a language issue if youre not a native speaker    anyhow no reason to get upset i wasnt insulting the car    dave,dhanley
706,September 2004,why dont you go back to post and see what was quoted ill give you a hint nice interior too bad its a boat    anyway i dont own the car and sertanly dont get insulted that easily it just looked funny the way you wrought it dont you get upset either its just a car forum not a wrighting class,pg48477
707,September 2004,hi all    i am getting close to making a decision on the above cars i had the 325i for a test drive of 2 days and must say it is very nice i found its over all ride and handling superb i will test drive the 240 elegance here in winnipeg canada next i would like your thoughts and feed back on a few things    what are you impressions of the upgrades to the 05 240 i think they are great and long over due esp in the case of the cd player to me they really enhance the qualityappearance of the interior    what options have you purchased and would purchase again and which would you not get again i intend to keep my options esp electronic to a minimum as i find the models well equipped and the less electronics imo the better    i have found the stereo on my 14 year old toyota very good i am not an audiophile so would i notice or appreciate an upgraded sound system on either of these cars i dont expect the standard system to be excellent but is is at least good    i have to say i find the exterior of the bmw very appealing over that of the mb but the interior of the mb has the bmw beat i love the comfortable sumptuousness of the mb interior    my travel needs are modest i will only put low city miles on it will get the extended warranty will baby it and hope to keep it for 8  10 years    while i think and feel both cars are excellent  i find both engines more that adequate for my driving needs i am inclined towards the 240 however my biggest reservation comes from concerns over mb quality i understand it is not what it has been i also understand that they are intentional about addressing this issue i also read the the c class was early on plagued with bugs this was esp true in the 2001 and possible 2002 model years can i assume that most of these c class bugs have been addressed what has been the experience of those who own 20020304 vehicles i dont expect a mb to be a good as a japanese car but i do expect it to be reasonably good and to hold its value over the long term    i appreciate your thoughtsthanks    b,bmbmw
708,September 2004,if youre gonna take good care of it both cars should last quite long with only minor problems  reliability like you said will never beat japanese brands but quite good overall with mb being a bit more reliable in my case 2005 mbs have new interior and seats since a lot of people complained about the seats hurting their back on long trips  sound systems in both cars are quite good if youre not an audiophile it has decent sound quality  options id choose will always include xenon headlights a must wood trim now std in bmw and leather i usually opt for premium package but since you choose to skip the electronics you might not need it afterall  hope it helps,m4d_cow
709,September 2004,if i were still living in winnipeg and consider getting a rwd car i would first consider the ground clearance the more the better i think the 240 has more clearance than the 325 then the next factor is winter tires options for the cars considered all season tires are not very safe for winter driving in a city like winnipeg and especially if you are going to baby it i would consider looking at the 4matic and the xi too just my 2 cents,eman6628
710,September 2004,i146ve had my 14604 325i for about 5 months now so i feel qualified to evaluate it and compare it to my previous car a 14698 audi audi 18t these cars are similarly equipped manual trans nonsport package with allseasons about the same size and performance category so a comparison seems fair at this point    engine 150 well the 325 is rated at 35hp over the audi so it146s pretty much no contest the engine is also smoother and really begs to be revved the audi would spool up pretty well too but i always felt like i was straining it a bit i am also not sorry to lose the turbo as i have always felt they add complexity under the hood that could be a longterm problem in fact the only major repair that i had to pay for on the audi was a 500 turborelated issue    transmission 150 pretty even here with both being 5speeds the audi had a bit softer of a clutch vs the bmw146s abruptness i am only now at the point where i can consistently make a really smooth 12 shift    handling 150 this is my first rwd car in many years and i forgot how different it feels the crisp turnin is especially noticeable and the steering overall has better feel than the audi ridewise the cars are pretty comparable well controlled firm but never harsh over rough pavement typically german the one thing the audi had going for it was of course the audi awd one of my favorite things to do you146re never too old to be immature was to outdrag someone at a stoplight on wet pavement i could pretty well mash the pedal to the floor coming out and the car would just go leaving the other guy spinning his front or rear wheels even with traction control on a rwd or fwd you146re not going to beat awd in slippery conditions    interior 150 audi is known for interior design and the audi did have very nice styling and controls layout the bmw is not as well coordinated but is a bit more businesslike in its appearance however i like my particular color combination better than the audi146s the sand leatherette along with black floormats and dash set off by the premium wood trim makes for a nice look as opposed to the audi that was all gray with some silver trim pieces the leatherette in the bmw is also a bit nicerappearing than the audi146s    the automatic climate control on the bmw is not quite as good at regulating temperature and air movement as the audi146s the fan seems to blow too high in some conditions and not fast enough in others the audi definitely had the best autotemp control that i have experienced    exterior 150 at the time that i picked out my audi it was the e36 that i compared it against and i thought the audi was better looking but ever since the e46 came out the next year my eye was always drawn to them when i spied one i still think though that the audi has classic good looks that i prefer to the newer model that was released in 14601 likewise i expect that i will still prefer the e46 after the e90 comes out    radio 150 no contest here the audi had a much superior standard radio on a few occasions i146ve wondered if the cds that i146m playing in the bmw are the same ones that i used to play in the audi    intangibles 150 i am not a status seeker but from the reaction of many people that i know i can see that the bmw nameplate carries a lot more prestige than most others everyone knows what a bmw is whereas i think that audi is less known and tends to get lumped with other secondtier european cars there is something about seeing that roundel on the steering wheel that makes me feel extra good about my choice    sumup 150 the 325i feels like a small performance sedan with luxury appointments and options the audi is more of a small luxury sedan that performs well and there you have it my opinion of course,gordonwd
711,September 2004,does the engine use in this car is designed by gm or is it a join design from gm and toyota  i know toyota have the vvt technology and this car use a 36l vvt engine which make me wonder did i bought a gm design or a toyota design,newdriver2
712,September 2004,i mean the engine use in the cadillac cts does it design by gm or by totoya,newdriver2
713,September 2004,its a gm engine if a slightly unusual onea large ohc job    its a world engine and is supposedly going to power the saabs soon bumped down to 28l and turbocharged,dhanley
714,October 2004,saab 93 earns double best pick    four of eight midsize cars earned good ratings in side impact crash tests recently conducted by the insurance institute for highway safety none of the cars received a poor rating the 2004 saab 93 2004 acura tl 2004 lexus es 330 and 2005 mitsubishi mitsubishi are rated good for side impact protection the 2004 saab 95 2005 mercedes benz c class and 2005 volvo s40 earned acceptable ratings the 2004 jaguar xtype is rated marginal    the better performers among vehicles that earn good ratings are designated best picks the saab 93 which also earned a best pick designation in the institutes frontal offset crash test is the first car to earn this designation in both front and side crash tests its a double best pick    earning a double best pick is a rare achievement says institute chief operating officer adrian lund the only other vehicle to have done this is the toyota rav4 a small suv and then only when it was equipped with optional side airbags,r34
715,October 2004,first off hats off to lexus for such a high class event and willingness to set up their 9 cars and 2 competitors in each category for the public to drive on a closed course i went saturday morning to fesubaru fields redskin stadium parking lot there was a quick registration orientation lexus autoshow display cooking demo kids corner a great buffet lunch and volkswagen pros to work with your swing but the main event was driving on three different courses luxury performance and suv i drove 10 of 27 different cars in 3 hours all were automatics traction control was required to remain engaged and the rule was do not exceed the cars or your ability    my notes on the cars of interest to this forum    lexus lexus underpowered six compared to the bmw and pontiac5 with a transmission that had longer shift delays competent handling and decent brakes but tended to understeer at the limit leading me to plow one hard corner racy interior with easy to use controls a good value choice if price and reliability are your top concerns in this segment the car for my younger brother    infiniti pontiac5 power oh baby this one has an engine the interior was not as bad to drive as others would lead you to believe but the handling is beneath the balance of the bmw and the lexus this is a car that makes the average driver me look bad saved by abs and the traction control system from a potentially scary rear end spin pontiac5 owners have a reasonably priced familysized car with v8like power but you can only put it down on the track if you really know what you are doing the car for a coworker who drag races on the weekends and takes four to lunch during the week    acura tl if i were picking a car for my wife sister real estate agent etc this would be the one beautiful jewellike interior with stateoftheart sound and all the features at a decent price plenty of power for the street it just doesnt handle like a sport sedan with front wheel drive    mercedes benz c320 softer ride lesspowerful engine smooth transmission nice interior others do different parts better at lower price points nice car but nothing special for the money pass if you got the bucks and want the star think amg    bmw 330i ok im biased but this car makes the average driver look good with an ideal balance of engine transmission handling and braking in a driveroriented interior drove a premium packaged car with steptronic moving the shifter inboard to sport and touching the dsc once i didnt turn it off iaw the rules and the car performs powerful acceleration outmatched only by the pontiac5 quick redline shifts that were the best great brakes and incredibly balanced handling i was foot to the floor threshold braking hands spinnning the wheel and having the time of my life much faster car for me because of the control available the standard 330i is under tired get the sport package for the performance tires sport seats and steering wheel the steptronic evaluated in s mode was much better than i expected give me a little more power more tire and a manual  oh thats my zhp i was still amazed at what a standard 330i can do driven much harder than ive ever driven my car which i have yet to track,jamesspot
716,October 2004,jamesspot what were the msrps for the respective vehicles too bad they were all automatics amazes me that lexus didnt use the 325ia 325i outsells the 330i by about a factor of 3to1 325i prices out with similar options like an lexus a decently optioned 330i can quickly push 40000 did the lexus have optional lsd and vsc,riez
717,October 2004,we just went from car to car they had info posters highlighting the specs of each of the automobiles lexus was amazingly fair in their presentation of all the cars  the class groupings had the lexus with the pontiac5 and the 330i the es330 which i didnt drive was grouped with the c320 and the tl  the pontiac5 and lexus are low 30s cars while a 330i step with premium package and the c320 are pushing 40k  the lexus did have traction control i didnt know whether it had lsd or not  i agree  the 325i is an even match for the lexus price wise the 330i is a much more expensive and capable car  since the event was for the general public invited by lexus marketing automatics were the only game in town for every car there i think i was invited as i went to the lexus web site and a dealership when i was looking at cars in the spring it did make me want to drive my car on the course,jamesspot
718,October 2004,i was recently at the autoshow in motion run by gm it was pretty similar in luxury cars there were all the saabs929395 the cts c320 tl 325i and the 530    i thought the tl really plowed dissapointingly much in turns even my buddy whos a huge honda fan didnt like it i think the acura is significantly more fun otoh the tl compares quite well with the c320    the cts is allright i just think the interior needs to be upgraded and it definitely needs the sport package same with the 93    i may be biased but even my hondaloving gm mechanic buddy liked the 2 bmw the best the 530 with the sport package was simply phenomenal    but thats offtopic    i also had a chance to drive the s40 t5 awd i really like the design cabin and volvos environmental ford i think its a pretty good car aside from fairly significant turbo lag oddly it seems to me to have more lag with its 25l than saabs almostaspowerful 20l it also still feels like a fwd car even with awd so pretty nice but not quite as sporty as i like i like that you can get a high end car without leather and wood neither of which i really care for    i think ill end up waiting to test the new 3series before i order anything and by then saab will have the 270hp turbo v6    well driving different cars is fun    dave,dhanley
719,October 2004,quotei mean the engine use in the cadillac cts does it design by gm or by totoya unquote    the 36 l engine used in the cts is pure gm designed and built its a great engine too with plenty of hp and torque nice and smooth running too gm is planning on using that same basic engine in lots of variations of size and power as premium engines in their up market cars    i owned an 04 cts with that engine and never had anything but good feelings about it there were other aspects of my cadillac buying experience that were far less satisfactory but the engine and 5 speed auto transmision were world class,scott1
720,October 2004,i own an 04 tl with 6 speed but have driven the acura auto only my thought is that the tl is a japanese implementation of an american concept whereas the acura is a japanese implementation of a european concept the acura is great fun to drive but the tl has deep down power is seriously fast and is as relaxing on a long drive as a large volvo albeit not quite as comfortable a couple of hundred miles passes with ease which despite their many supposed faults is true of larger american vehicles the acura is more alive in your hands less relaxed ultimately not as fast    the tls clutch is fierce but the shift is nice once you get used to it drive something else for a while and i guarantee youll engage 1st with a bang when you next drive the tl the tls bridgestones aquaplane too easily  makes me wish for my volkswagens excellent continentals,nkeen
721,November 2004,had no problem on unsalted hilly wisconsin roads    rwd  snows   fwd  awd   allseasons,dhanley
722,November 2004,no matter what you drive awd 4wd fwd rwd your car will benefit from using dedicated snow tires one reason the more drivingserious europeans drive about 75 summerwinter tires vs only 25 allseason tires percentages reversed in usa    is fascinating that so many americans will spend 3050k on a sport sedan but then drive on mediocre allseason tires all that separates you and the road is a small contact patch of rubber buy the best tires that means dedicated summer really 3season tires and dedicated winter tires    key to safe winter driving is driving skill traction is reduced modify your driving habits select the right gear apply the throttle differently take things slower    nothing used to bring a bigger smile to my face more in winter than driving my rwd 97 chevrolet with snow tires and seeing all the suvs in the ditch during a snow storm because their foolish driver thought they were invulnerable to winter conditions they would barrel past me on interstate at 70 mph while im doing 55 mph then down road i pass em while they dig out of a snow bank,riez
723,November 2004,what do you guys do keep a set of wheels with summer and winter tires    then have them swapped out between season    man im glad i live in ca,wco81
724,November 2004,yes i have a set of inexpensive winter wheels borbet type e with a set of michelin arctic alpin tires mounted on them i put them on in november and usually take them off in march or april    man im glad i live in ca    hmmm the cost of my winter set is less than a fifth of the extra taxes that id be paying per year if i lived in california that and my 1500 square foot basement has lots of space to store a set if tires man im glad i live in new hampshire     best regards  shipo,shipo
725,November 2004,last weekend i put a set of bridgestone blizzak ws50 20555subaru6 91q tires on my wifes lexus sportcross wagon bought em thru the tire rack part of their lexus package 800 for tires 105t  alloy wheels 95w plus 7740 for freight and then a final 20 at installation grand total of 89940    had the four tireswheels shipped directly to one of the participating tire rack installers in omaha ne to haas very easy to order no problems with installation worked like a charm    im going to put on a set of snow tires for my 04 lexus sedan im still deciding looking at dunlop snow sport bmw or michelin arctic alpin ill likely make my mind up this week    dont forget that taller narrower winter tires work best so for me that means going from 17 inch to 16 inch tires,riez
726,November 2004,i really like the arctic alpin tires lots of grip in the slippery stuff quiet on dry pavement that said given their 100 mph limit im probably inclined to spend an extra 20 or so per tire next time and buy something like the michelin honda alpin pa2 tires yeah yeah i know i live in new england and cannot really use a tire with a higher speed rating all that often that said last winter on one of my trips to nyc i was on the mass pike tooling along with a group of about 6 cars at about 100 when another group of about 10 cars caught us and passed us the cars in my group accelerated and joined the larger group that is except me     best regards  shipo,shipo
727,November 2004,hmmm the cost of my winter set is less than a fifth of the extra taxes that id be paying per year if i lived in california that and my 1500 square foot basement has lots of space to store a set if tires man im glad i live in new hampshire     lol you got me on that one shipo of course im originally from nh so i may find that a little more amusing than most people also my wife is from ca  hence why i have to buy her an awd car xi and equip it with blizzaks  i have read previously that a rwd car is easier to drive up a hill than a fwd car equipped with comparable tires due to the weight shift to the rear  you may want to consider that in your decision,paule
728,November 2004,oddly enough my wife is from california as well this whole winter thing is still a little new to her even after living in the nyc metro area for over a dozen years and now our third winter in nh me i originally hail from michigan although i too lived in ca for several years in the end i had to move back up north i missed winter too much and weekend visits up to mammoth just didnt give me enough of a fix     regarding up hill in a rwd car yes i believe that depending upon the situation it is easier assuming you can maintain enough momentum to keep the front wheels rolling fast enough to allow you enough steerage to correct for the resultant fishtailing yikes what a sentence my mom was an english teacher  that said of all the cars that ive ever owned my hill climbing champ was indeed a car setup in the fwd configuration my 1982 audi 4000 talk about lowtech fwd how on earth could that have been my best climber simple in reverse  i was on my way to an assignation which included an almost empty rental ski condo a hot fire and good food and wine up in boyne city mi and all that stood between me and valhalla was a very steep slippery snow and ice covered dirt road after several attempts to climb the hill nose first i sat at the bottom for a few minutes and thought about the situation logically i popped it in reverse and climbed that hill with absolutely no problem    when i pulled up in front of the condo she came out and asked how in the hell did you get your car up here i needed to park in town and bum a ride from somebody with a jeep    i dont think i ever actually confessed to her that i did it in reverse     best regards  shipo,shipo
729,November 2004,hmm have you considered pontiac5x its got awd for sure  and no belive me you dont want summer tires in heavy snow it almost got me killed once though i dont know how much it snows in dc but it cant be worse than minneapolis right,m4d_cow
730,November 2004,as sonny elliot sp the old weatherman from detroit used to say the folks in the dc area get lots of frizzle freezing rain and drizzle slice slush that then freezes to ice and slow sleet and snow mixture speaking stictly for myself id rather drive in a good old fashioned minneapolis snow storm anyday compared to a dc slow storm     best regards  shipo,shipo
731,November 2004,alright i have to throw in two cents to keep this place honest    i used to live in 10000 feet up in the colorado rockies at first i was intimidated by the thought of snow storms and compromises with mobility then i quickly realized that the snow crews are nothing like nyc areas where you sometimes have to wait a day to have roads cleared in dem dere mountains snow barely had a chance to touch the ground before they would clear the roads the more populated areas anyway my brother lived in montreal and it146s pretty much the same way so it seems to me that one146s daily conditions play a role when considering winter driving equipment if you can whisk your way onto clear roads and highway the risk of getting marooned is considerably lower    i often find myself on lots of hills with plenty of deep stuff andor ice i know a thing or two about getting by with two wheels but nothing beats awd in snow151nothing never even came close to having a snag you have to use more skill and savvy with the others like taking circuitous routes home maintaining momentum into a hill or driving uphill backwards not many people would think of these things    i agree that allseason tires are not the way to go with rwd and fwd they have mostly summertire characteristics and i would only use them with awd even then they compromise traction braking and handling in snow    bottom line here driving in snow with rwd and fwd is like jogging with florsheim winvolkswagenps sure you can do it but a pontiac5x 325xi or anything else like this is a great choice    shipo your mom should be proud of you151i see nothing wrong with that sentence i would imagine however that she wouldn146t approve of your 100 mph jaunts     you ca people must me totally bored with this stuff question…does hyundai claus go to places like san diego indeed i envy you,designman
732,November 2004,i have them on my wifes car the handling is incredible im sure you give up some snow traction to a qrated tire but she never came close to getting stuck last year if we drove in heavy snow frequently i might have a different opinion but i recommend the vrated enthusiastically we have goodyears    regards  kyfdx  moderator    prices paid lease questions suvs,kyfdx

734,November 2004,hmmm i gotta disagree with you about some if this i regularly drive two fwd cars and one rwd car shod with winter tires and i think that there is little comparison the rwd car seems to have significantly better traction in all driving regimens so based upon that i would suggest a slight change to your chart for traction i assume we are only talking about acceleration here    1 awd wwinter tires  2 awd wallseason tires  3 rwd wwinter tires  4 fwd wwinter tires  5 fwd wallseason tires  6 rwd wallseason tires     im not completely convinced that the awd car with allseasons would be of any advantage over the rwd car with winter tires    then again there are the issues of handling and braking and if i remember the results of the sidebyside test performed by an auto magazine several years ago using cars as nearly matched as possible mb e320 4matic mb e320 rwd audi audi audi audi audi fwd the results shifted more in favor of the winter tire shod rwd car in fact if im not mistaken in the braking department the rwd car easily won due to its inherently more neutral frontrear weight distribution especially compared to the fwd audi combined with its relatively lighter weight compared to the two awd cars    personally i am willing to give up some go power to gain some stop power hence my comment that i believe that a rwd car especially one with a near neutral weight distribution shod with winter tires offers the best driving experience for winter driving that said if i lived in a mountainous area such as the rockies i would certainly opt for the awd car simply because on a steep enough hill the fwdrwd car simply aint gonna start moving from a standing stop while the awd car will move away from the stop with relative aplomb     best regards  shipo,shipo
735,November 2004,why do you have 5  6 flipflopped in comparison to 3  4 is this what the magazine test indicated it seems to suggest this in your manner of reference but its not quite clear and at the same time curious,designman
736,November 2004,i never really expected this would stray so far off topic but i guess you can expect this discussion this time of year    anyways i now believe it is possible to drive uphill on snow in summer tires because the wife actually likes the pontiac5 family not so much the sedan its looks arent the best imo but the coupe i will admit that driving a rwd coupesedan is just a completely different experience from a fwd in this case different is much better the handling acceleration and braking are all a world better    i am aware of the pontiac5x but i was really hoping to get the 6speed of course the wife wandered over to the infiniti and i knew it was all over fortunately this is my car so theres a chance that i will win this battle    the dealer had some 05 pontiac5xs in stock but i didnt get a chance to see one or drive one the interior is supposed to be up in quality now vs the 04s unfortunately the 6speed wont be around until late january or februaryand i need a car now since mine is totalled    thanks for all the comments on winter tires and such im paying cash for the car anyways so i might as well just take 1000 and get a quality set of winter tires then i can run summerwinters and have it all geeze having your cake and eat it toosay it aint so    tim,tim_hooligan
737,November 2004,i have two sets of winter tires also for both cars i dont mind the trouble of switching them and spending 1k for a set of spare wheels n winter tires well it keeps you out of trouble eventhough they still spin a little bit but not as often i have to stay with my the onlylast insurance company some accidents before    and i also put some heavy stuff in the trunk so if the fwder has an engine on top of their front wheels i got my small loaded fridge on the top of my rear wheels well it works it does help traction and a happy 2035 mph on snow lol,williamhill
738,November 2004,i just came back from the dealer they had 2005pontiac5x did not get a chance to drive it but spend some time in the car i do find that seat controls are in the wrong spot but the seat is very comfortable both driver and passenger even though interior design is pretty much the same as 04 materials used are much better gages are still orange but way better looking than 04 and does not look at all like the one in nissan before interior was the only thing in the way of buying a car and i was leaning more towards tl but now i think g is the one have to convince my wife to get a infiniti and the deal is done,pg48477
739,November 2004,well i was trying to show there is a big difference between go power and stopturn power    ive had four awds with three different awd4wd systems and everyone of them had better traction go power with allseasons than any 2wd car ive driven with winter tires including my current one    and although i would rather have rwdwinters than fwdwinters for the overall handling experience stopturngo power if i am considering only traction go power i still have to go with the fwd    i will grant that the type of car makes a difference though a large car with a long wheelbase loses some of the traction advantage that fwd provides by moving more of the weight off the front wheels my old 82 honda hatchback with 6364 of the weight over the front wheels would leave any rwd car spinning its wheels a new tl or lexus would have much less advantage over a 5series or gs300    regards  kyfdx  moderator    prices paid lease questions suvs,kyfdx
740,November 2004,everything ive heard so far says that the interior of the pontiac5 is much improved for 2005but the sticky issue is that the 6speeds wont be coming out until late january or early february since my car is totalled i am in need of a car very very soon puts me in quite the pickle i dont really want to settle for an 04 but i cant think of any other choicebesides renting a car until that time ouch     i do agree the placement for the seat adjustment is wrong but the seats are quite comfortable if you are not tooo wide in the backside    i suppose i could settle with the automatic 05 or even an 04 6speed but something tells me ill regret it on the other hand arent the 04s going for well under invoice now theres quite a few things i can spend 34k on    vegas,tim_hooligan

744,November 2004,for more horses at that price point and similar features i guess you could go with the 35000 pontiac5    35k for a pontiac5 who pays msrp for a pontiac5,blueguydotcom
745,November 2004,all my figures were just msrp not saying that anyone pays msrp for a pontiac5 no one pays msrp for a 3 series either at least i hope not    the discounting makes the pontiac5 even a better deal since one can generally discount a pontiac5 more off msrp than a 3 series    you do get free maintenance and better gas mileage with the 3 both 30 and 25 however    what is the present day worth of the free maintenance anyway,jrock65
746,November 2004,the discounting makes the pontiac5 even a better deal since one can generally discount a pontiac5 more off msrp than a 3 series      until november there was a 3k rebate on the 330i so figuring subtract that from 400 over invoice and youre talking about over 5k off the msrp sticker on a 330i are people getting pontiac5s for 5k off sticker if so thats awesome,blueguydotcom
747,November 2004,hello if you are in vegas as your post said i bought an 04 pontiac5 sedan in late sept for 500 under invoice at the dealership here both are owned by the sale company and if it is of interest to you i bought my car at the sahara dealership best regards,slotmaker
748,November 2004,i didnt know that you could get 5000 off msrp on a 330i that is awesome    historically my impression is that the 3 series was harder to discount than the pontiac5 sedan,jrock65
749,November 2004,historically nope theoretically yes  in reality its easier to get 330is for 5k under msrp than getting a 325i for 5k under msrp due to the fact that 325i sells a whole lot better and it holds better value when youre reselling it,m4d_cow

758,January 2005,uglier than the pontiac         in your opinion but then it wasnt meant to appeal to everyone         its a lot better than some blandmobile that no one really cares about and from the sales figures it seems a whole lot of people really like it plus it hasnt gotten tired sales have increased every year since it came out,eaton53
759,January 2005,i looked at all the caddys at the autoshow and was not impressed first thing is the 42000 sticker for a heavy underpowered lux over sport vehicle then you have to look at it 300c beats caddy at their own game for 57k less and if you prefer a little sporting character with your lux all three japanese premium brands had superior styling quality content and value euros have the hardware if you want to pay a 510k premium what is even more surprising is looking down market for a mainstream 4door sedan it is incredible how outtolunch the domestics are ford 500 are you kidding me,indydriver
760,January 2005,first thing is the 42000 sticker for a heavy underpowered lux over sport vehicle         very high end of the scale there most cts arent anywhere near that much and there are obviously a large number of people like their sports sedans not to beat them up         its also a bigger car many people also appreciate the space it offers         the 36 is underpowered only in some alternate universe 255 hp and 252 lbft of torque on regular gas         then you have to look at it 300c beats caddy at their own game for 57k less         have you driven one i have the 300c is not nearly as good as an all around vehicle fast in a straight line sure but throw in some corners and theres lots of body roll and tire squeal caddys dont do any of that         300c lacks the chassis composure to be a sports sedan its a fast chrysler         and if you prefer a little sporting character with your lux all three japanese premium brands had superior styling         in your opinion imo except for the pontiac5 theyre bland too small or have wrong wheel drive          quality         cadillac is one of only 3 manufacturers in the top 5 of all 3 power surveys only one of the others is japanese sorry but the surveys dont back up these superior quality claims         content and value         theyre all loaded and cost similar amounts nothing there         euros have the hardware if you want to pay a 510k premium         for a less reliable product,eaton53
761,January 2005,not that i like getting caught up in the useless sales numbers but i had to ask why there is a discrepancy between shapiros numbers and dannys numbers         if i add up all of dannys 3series numbers i get less than 69k i didnt do exact just a rough addup in my head but shaps obviously shows almost 40k more than that whats missing coupes and convertibles did they really sell almost 40k coupes and convertibles thats a huge number for niche styles like that  17 ford crew 27 67 coronet rt 14 towncountry limited 09 lsubaru hse 44car history and counting,qbrozen

763,January 2005,but the original post says 325i and 330i i would think that would include wagons since wagons also have those same designations the only things missing are the ci but maybe youre right and wagons arent in there i dont know  17 ford crew 27 67 coronet rt 14 towncountry limited 09 lsubaru hse 44car history and counting,qbrozen

765,January 2005,oops yer right it was right there in the title of the post no wagons         yeah the es looks to be popular but the is and gs numbers are downright pitiful  17 ford crew 27 67 coronet rt 14 towncountry limited 09 lsubaru hse 44car history and counting,qbrozen
766,January 2005,qbrozen cant say i agree with your statement yeah the es looks to be popular but the is and gs numbers are downright pitiful         i would agree that lexus should be ashamed of how little they advertisemarket both the is and gs given that lexus does next to nothing to promote either and that both are in the last my of their current platform id say sales are absolutely amazingly good         lexus sedan holding up compared to bmw 330i sedan         and the gs competes against a different class of cars eclass audi and 5 series         if you add up all the lexus sedan saleses gs and islexus dealers are happy plus about 50 of all lexus sales are suvs suvs are where lexus action has been for about 5 years now,riez
767,January 2005,well comparing just the 330i to the lexus is not quite kosher just because lexus doesnt offer 2 engine choices in their car or the option of awd does not justify limiting 3series sales to one option         less than 7k cars is quite pitiful imho toyota decided to kill the celica after it sold more than double that number in 2003 so why kill a car with 15k sales and keep one with 7k         im not arguing as to why it suffers in sales just that it does  17 ford crew 27 67 coronet rt 14 towncountry limited 09 lsubaru hse 44car history and counting,qbrozen
768,January 2005,i looked at all the caddys at the autoshow and was not impressed         hm i drove the cts at gms autoshow in motion back to back with the tl i think the only way the tl was better is that its interior quality was somewhat better aside from that the cts handled better was more spacious and the engine felt better  quieter smoother less peaky          the cts stickers for a smidge less than the tl and you can surely get a bigger discount on it,dhanley
769,January 2005,unfortunately that smidge cheaper cts is lacking in content compared to the tl add in the 8k 1sc package and youve just blown the tls price out of the water  17 ford crew 27 67 coronet rt 14 towncountry limited 09 lsubaru hse 44car history and counting,qbrozen
770,January 2005,you can get a cts anyway you want it if you want to pay more you can if you want it stripped you can get that too two different engines auto or manual with either one and they all drive the rear wheels         just because you want that stuff doesnt mean everyone does,eaton53
771,January 2005,i just got my pontiac5 am happy and very excited         md4cow was right the tl had all the stuff that we all wanted better ride powerful yet quiet smooth engine good handling good mpg interior tons of features although im not a techy person but boy the navigation and its voice command over temperatureradio etc really impressed me a lot         but too bad they wouldnt budge for more discount         im quite happy with the g especially when the car will only be driven by me my family just cant handle the ride         imo the tl is more like a handsome muscular looking car while the g is more to the sweet and exotic type eventhough the tl rode  turned as flat as the g but i do believe theres a hair difference somewhere    the salesman was with me so i didnt have a chance to feel the torque steer    did go fast into a corner but i guess it was not fast enough         thanks for all the info guys really happy with this experience,darrenw
772,January 2005,darrenw         curious on what you decided i have had my pontiac5x for about 10 days now and so far know regrets even had it out in some wet snow tonight and it was fine         i found that all of the cars in the mix you were looking at did not have such great mpg if you are talking about these high powered engines i suspect this has something to do with it it looks to me that i will be getting somewhere around 325 to 350 miles on a tank with all the city driving i do not much different than ford my infiniti replaced         the only reason i nixed the tl was just looks it drove nice and actually had a few more features for less money since it was fwd vs awd         hope you found the car you wanted         regards    cdost,cdost1
773,January 2005,well it has little to do with what i want it has to do with comparing comparable cars dont get me wrong i think its great that someone can buy a stripped cts if they want but that doesnt mean its comparable to the tl  17 ford crew 27 67 coronet rt 14 towncountry limited 09 lsubaru hse 44car history and counting,qbrozen
774,January 2005,but that doesnt mean its comparable to the tl         sorry but because of its inherently flawed fwd design no tl is superior to a cts no matter how many gadgets you pile onto it         proper sports sedans are driven by the rear wheels or with rwd based awd for some reason acura hasnt figured this out when everyone else has,eaton53
775,January 2005,groan    yeah lets dig up that horse again  17 ford crew 27 67 coronet rt 14 towncountry limited 09 lsubaru hse 44car history and counting,qbrozen
776,January 2005,yeah lets dig up that horse again         well youre right theres no point to digging it up until someone builds a fwd sports sedan that can run with the really big dogs of the sports sedan universe then you can come on and proclaim its superiority,eaton53
777,January 2005,congrats on both your purchases         darren to add the info tls nav system is considered one of the most userfriendly system in the market nowadays         cdost the mpg stuff makes me wonder some people claim the tl have better mpg than pontiac5 while others claim the opposite and until now i still have no clue which one is right,m4d_cow
778,January 2005,then you can come on and proclaim its superiority         by you i presume you mean any person in general and not me because you wont see me doing it id rather proclaim one cars advantages over another and not argue in generalized terms since it does very little to further a discussion  17 ford crew 27 67 coronet rt 14 towncountry limited 09 lsubaru hse 44car history and counting,qbrozen
779,January 2005,someone a while back posted the sales  for 2004 and it seems that the best selling entry luxo sedans in us last year were the inferior fwders es and tl how the heck could that happen the universe must be educated more by the rwdwing,igiban

781,March 2005,seldom does this subject come up on these boardsits usually discussed in the minivan threads my 3 kids are now 8 6 and 3 so im just a few years beyond you we own an honda and just bought an 05 tl infiniti one key for us was enough width across the back seat for the 3 kids 2 of them in booster seats narrowed to nissan nissan slightly more room and tl because we felt most of the other contenders in this category would be too small so far were very pleased with our choice getting the kids in and out of the back is not as easy as in the van but still not a problem btw they love the dvd surround sound in the acura and fight over who gets next i didnt drive the infinity dt the perception it wasnt quite as big as the other 2 in the end my advice is to figure out the way to get the best combination of practical kids and fun mom and dad hope this helps,wisngamecock
782,March 2005,1st i agree with wisngamecock that the tl  nissan nissan would probably do better with car seats than the pontiac5 or volkswagen volkswagen bc of size the nissan is bigger than the tl but you lose some handling    more importantly though im concerned about your comment as follows    the tl has a latch position in the center so you can place a rearfacing car seat in the middle and still have room for 2 adults on the outside positions    i have an 04 tl and use a car seat as i did with my prior 20015 volkswagen and i dont think there is a center latch set in the acura please please please count the number of latches i believe youll find 4 and even though it is possible to attach the seat in the middle youll be doing so using the inside passengerside latch and the inside driverside latch latches are not tested this way they are intended to have pressure applied to the same set of latches so please make sure you find a car with 6 latches in the back if you want to latch in the center,ljwalters1
783,March 2005,ljwalters1  thanks for the comment about the number of latches i was looking at the 05 tl and i am pretty sure there are 3 pairs of latches in the back but i will reach in the back seat and count again i should find a total of 6 latch connections if not then there goes the idea of placing the car seat in the middle,vanhalenabe
784,March 2005,i was fortunate enough to drive a 2005 pontiac5 infiniti for a few days and it was so interesting to me how i walked away from it i was very strongly considering buying the car as a replacement to my 2003 330i as it is bigger and a little more family friendly here is my opinion    1 i know the pontiac5 is faster on paper but it sure does not feel faster i guess it has to do with the overall size of the car but the bmw simply felt like it had more pop    2 i do admit the g has the bimmer beat in some areas back seat stereo and you can even argue it has a more modern look    3 but i am here to tell you that everything people say about bmw is absolutely correct the biggest difference for me was behind the wheel and the connection you have with your surroundings and the road it is truly amazing to me    so in conclusion i decided to stay in my 2003 330i and wait to see the 06 3series    the funniest thing to me was i walked away thinking that it is either a bmw or it is not and i will look again in time at the pontiac5 and the new lexus is but in the end i believe that if i do not get a bmw i am going to load up a honda honda and be mr family guy    really whats the difference because if you want the best get it sports sedanbmw family sedan  honda eom,djocks
785,March 2005,i know the pontiac5 is faster on paper but it sure does not feel faster i guess it has to do with the overall size of the car but the bmw simply felt like it had more pop    when i drove the two cars back to back auto the g definitely felt faster and that was with the 260hp 2003 pontiac5 the 280hp 2005 pontiac5 should be even faster    the g is simply a bigger sedan than the 3 that alone works against it in terms of handling,jrock65
786,March 2005,i am on the fence i live in chicago weather and all and am considering the rwd pontiac5 could someone tell me how it truly performs on wetsnowy climates it would be appreciated the dealer told me its great in snow but i dont believe him i would consider the pontiac5x but the mileage issue and that its just another thing to go wrong w the car has me concerned    the acura tl is my other option but i am totally infatuated w the look and feel of the pontiac5 thanks,sullyone
787,March 2005,i have the same dilemma but have even more snow than you we got 12 tueswed in south bend when chicago got maybe 1 ive read opinions here varying from ok to lousy dont even think about summer tires in the winter seems to me that rwd with tcs shouldnt be any worse than fwd wo tcs    which dealer are you working with,lmacmil
788,March 2005,an infiniti dealership in subaruville il my insurance agent has one and she said its very light in the back and recommended snow tires just not sure i want to spend that kind of money and deal w the hassle every year thanks for your comments,sullyone
789,March 2005,otoh 20 years ago we were all driving rwd cars and seemed to manage even without traction control,lmacmil
790,March 2005,there was no such a thing as summer performance tires for the average sedan either if you live in the snow belt and buy a car with performance tires do yourself a favor buy a set of winter tires    best regards  shipo,shipo
791,March 2005,if you can still find one and if youre willing to give up a sporty driving experience you could try the infiniti i35 i drive one and it seems more family friendly and cheaper than the pontiac5 sure its a little dated and its essentially a nissan with a different badge but most dealers will be trying to unload their leftover 2004 inventory the i35 also seems to have the most space in the entire entry level luxury class and i feel that its a pretty good value    warning you may have problems finding one equipped the way you liked i wanted the navigation system and the nearest dealer that had one was in atlanta and i wasnt willing to travel that far i compromised and bought a base model,jchan2
792,March 2005,get winter tires all around and youll be fine  assuming you have a clue in the first place how to drive in snow    ive driven a 65 mgb through two winters in edmonton followed by a 73 240z for three more winters    tires  common sense trump frontwheel drive all day long awd is pretty hard to beat but the rest of the year you get to drag around more weight and all where you dont want it,cdnpinhead
793,March 2005,youre very welcome btw because of this stream i rechecked my 04 tl and theres definitely only 2 sets of latches itd be nice if their was a middle set but i dont know if the backseets wide enough for that    ps  putting the carseat behind the passenger seat is better than the middle for ease of getting the baby inout and with rearfacing seats its easier for my hand to touch my baby  the middle position is actually too close for me i find the middle position is only nice 1 if therell be 2 small people sitting in the back too or 2 on long trips when the baby can better enjoy looking out the front window with a frontfacing seat or 3 therell be someone in the front passenger seat and the middle position is easier for them,ljwalters1
794,March 2005,im just replying to 1 part of your post  seems to me that rwd with tcs shouldnt be any worse than fwd wo tcs    i wouldnt be so sure of that a fwd car gets better traction bc the engine sits over the wheels that drive and that weight provides increased traction  probably due to increased friction with the road dont know if there are studies on that tcs does not increase traction  it just makes the best use of whatever traction is there by increasing the drive power of whichever wheel has traction it cant create traction which the fwd car does bc of the engine placement i would thing a fwd car would generally be better than rwd w tcs,ljwalters1
795,March 2005,well are you talking about acceleration or handling eg not skidding in incliment conditions,dhanley
796,March 2005,currently i have a rwd w tcs and stability a fwd wout tcs and an awd wout tcs the rwd is still the worst of all my cars in poor road conditions  17 ford crew 27 67 coronet rt 14 towncountry limited 09 lsubaru hse 44car history and counting,qbrozen
797,March 2005,have you tried winter tires i would have agreed with you until i bought a set for my current rwd car those tires michelin arcticalpins have transformed my car from the worst winter driver to the best i have ever had would an awd equipped car shod with winter tires perform even better in acceleration almost certainly however given that my car is still more than capable until the snow rises above the door sills i dont see any advantage to awd considering the handling and braking disadvantages that come with the extra weight of the additional drivetrain hardware    best regards  shipo,shipo
798,March 2005,kd i know you and i have had some heated discussions in the past about bmw and acura  but in all honesty this car is the only car that has out right left me and my tls in the dust  so i crossed enemy lines on saturday just to get a taste of what this car feels like    i went to the local bmw dealer and test the 545 with the sport package  i was blown away this car is fast and i mean fast on every aspect of the revband  it was surprising to me that the dealer let me go on the test drive all by myselfi went there back in 99 when i was cross shopping the 3 tl and the millennia and they wanted to put a traking device on the car    anyway i think it is out of my price range but who knows in few years i might buy one used,billyperks
799,March 2005,no argument from me i personally love acuras and think the tl is a lot of car for the money it just isnt for me    i love the 545i also not even close to being an option for me due to finances fuel mileage desire to keep eating etc    if i had 50k60k to spend though i think id still pick the 530i and eat at a five star restsaturnnt once per month     im guessing for most people that buy the 545i that isnt an eitheror decision  moderator    prices paid lease questions suvs,kyfdx
800,March 2005,i dont know why that would matter traction is traction whether its off the line cruising or in a turn unless you want to work torque steer into the equation im not a physicist so im afraid weve reached the limits of my thinking,ljwalters1
801,March 2005,traction is traction whether its off the line cruising or in a turn    well no not really static weight distribution ie frontrear weight bias and driving dynamics play a substantial part in winter driving as well    three examples assuming two otherwise identical fwd and rwd cars driving in snowy conditions    acceleration under light acceleration ie very little front to rear weight transfer the fwd car with its 6040 weight distribution will have more traction than the rwd car with its 5050 weight distribution however under stronger acceleration since weight transfers to the rear in such a situation the front tires will lose traction whereas the rwd car will gain traction    around a curve the lighter back end of the fwd car will come unglued before the heavier front end of the car under some circumstances while in others accelerating through a curve for instance since the front tires are being asked to do double duty accelerating and turning they will break loose and plow before the back end a rwd car with a good traction control system will be less prone to either of those two scenarios    braking the fwd car which already has a significant front end bias will load up even more with the weight transfer of braking allowing the back end to become very light and lose traction and without the aid of tcs could very well find said back end leading the front end down the road the rwd car given its better balance will be less susceptible to that situation as well    best regards  shipo,shipo
802,March 2005,no i havent tried winter tires but to answer your second question i have to extrapolate that since my rwd car has the worst traction while none of my cars have winter tires it would still have the worst traction if all of my cars had winter tires it may no longer be dangerous but it would still suffer by comparison    regardless i just dont want to spend the money and time at this point to buy special tires and change them depending on the weather i kept my fwd car so that i can leave the rwd car at home when necessary    now lets keep in mind that not all tractionstability systems are created equal i found the system in the mercedes benz to be far more capable and far more transparent than the system in my 350z im confident that good tires on the mercedes benz with that system would be much more suited to adverse weather than my z with even some of the best tires  17 ford crew 27 67 coronet rt 14 towncountry limited 09 lsubaru hse 44car history and counting,qbrozen
803,March 2005,fair enough i must say that the tcs system on my 530i is quite impressive and coupled with the additional winter tires i ordered the sport package which includes summer tires my car has gone from completely undrivable in anything more than a dusting of snow to being able to easily plow through six inches as quickly as if not quicker than the ubiquitous suvs that many here in southern new hamster drive given that we are in the midst of our second one hundred inch or more winter in the last three seasons ive had ample opportunity to drive with four to six inches on the roads    best regards  shipo,shipo
804,March 2005,regardless i just dont want to spend the money and time at this point to buy special tires and change them depending on the weather i kept my fwd car so that i can leave the rwd car at home when necessary    winter tires are a marginal expense  your summer tires will last longer because they are resting 12 the year  its a lot cheaper than buyingmaintaininginsuring two cars    i dont understand this incredible aversion so many people have to winter tires if you live in a snowy area its a better safety investment than fwd awd airbags stability control and all the other things car companies have convinced us to spend money on    dave,dhanley

807,March 2005,i hear what youre saying but in my case i didnt buy another car i just didnt sell one besides not only am i saving the miles on my summer tires on the z but im saving miles off the entire car by driving a different one altogether    maintenance costs nothing extra because the miles are split between the cars so im still doing maintenance at the same pace if you count performing it half as much on twice the cars    insurance eh not enough to worry about 40 a month is worth it for me especially when you figure in the added bonus of being able to keep a 2seat sportscar on hand while still having the 4seat sedan for mazdal duties whereas many many people sacrifice the sportscar because they had a baby or whatever edit  oh and a whole other set of tires and wheels would cost me probably nearly the same as 2 years of insurance on that 2nd car    notice i mentioned time and money obviously money isnt the big issue with me time and something else i forgot  garage storage space for those extra wheelstires is    anyway  were really way off topic oh the car i wound up not selling when i got my z is my entry level performance sedan  17 ford crew 27 67 coronet rt 14 towncountry limited 09 lsubaru hse 44car history and counting,qbrozen
808,March 2005,40 a month for insurance  480 a year equal to a set of snows swapping takes maybe an hour a year depreciation and maintainance are partially time based as well    now you dont have to justify wanting to have a extra 2 seat sports car to me though after all were not all driving 1000 old beaters,dhanley
809,March 2005,i guess i cant post a link but its in the auto technology section they compared similar size fwd to rwd cars one was the pontiac5 in wet and dry acceleration and slalomlane change with and without tcs on their conclusion was neither frontwheel drive nor rearwheel drive is really better than the other    in my relatively snowy area 68 this season so far im leaning towards the tl or acura over the pontiac5 because of the fwd and arguably nicer interiors,lmacmil
810,March 2005,um theres no reason why you cant post a link to popular mechanics technology section unless it is a paid subscription area that would be okay too just explain that in your post are you concerned about our no links to other automotive message boards deal any article on popular mechanics  or anywhere as long as it is not directly into another automotive forum  should be fine    take a look at our rules of the road linked at the top of the page they should answer any question you might have about what can be linked and what cannot but if you have further questions feel free to drop me an email,pat
811,April 2005,wow couldnt disagree more the 25 gt limited has you sit up high like a pontiac5 the interiors very basic and very cheap feeling no auto window updown thats right one window has auto down cheapy leather clunky plastics and the engineayecarumba it pulls strongly but its load and sounds like it may break at any moment gas mileage is horrid even on the freeway at cruising speeds in 5th the engine is pulling high rpms if one runs 80 mph youre never gonna break 2222 mpg on a long trip,blueguydotcom
812,April 2005,you may as well look at the subaru sti and mitsubishi evo for that price range if youre looking for more space or less  junk in the interior but want to avoid the tl and cts theres always the pontiac5 nissan se and nissan ser    for decent gas mileage go with the small simple japanese cars nissan ser spec v and toyota xrs they are fun and are more practical than the mini cooper s,398lbft
813,April 2005,httpwwwautoreportnetinsubaruhtmltm200501html    well i guess this confirms that the 35 gr v6 will go in the next es    the cx2535 must be an infiniti version of the actic concept    httpmotortrendcomautoshowscovitinsubaru18html    the cx25 will probably get the 25 v6 vq used in the japanese skyline and fuga that engine makes about 210 hp 197 torque    this bodes well for a infiniti in the next model change it will battle the lexus 325i and audi 18    acura csx what the hell is that when you google honda csx a lawn mower comes up,jrock65
814,April 2005,yeah just what the es needs 300 hp through the front wheels and yet it will sell,blueguydotcom
815,April 2005,well i couldnt disagree more after making the rounds to many many dealers including subaru i understand why subaru owners are passionate about their cars their interiors may not be up to bmw quality but their drivetrain is every bit as good the subaru xt premium for example cant hold a candle amenity wise to any car in this thread but it will go to 60 in 525 seconds and it costs 15k less than the 330 the 15k one could save could be invested in another car the market your houseetc so yes the compromise is in the interior but there is no compromise with the smoothness of the shifter engine or drivetrain    while you might be right about the gas mileage running within legal limits will bump the gas mileage to about 30 show me any car that goes 0 to 60 in 525 seconds like the subaru cadillacee review in caranddrivercom  and gets 30 mpg going 80 on the freeway,kdshapiro
816,April 2005,so yes the compromise is in the interior but there is no compromise with the smoothness of the shifter engine or drivetrain    absolutely 100 disagree the engine shifter and tranny are rough unrefined loud and fill me with anything but confidence in the cars abilities    while you might be right about the gas mileage running within legal limits will bump the gas mileage to about 30 show me any car that goes 0 to 60 in 525 seconds like the subaru cadillacee review in caranddrivercom  and gets 30 mpg going 80 on the freeway    the scooby xt wont get 30 mpg running 80 mph hondaing to edmunds the 2005 xt manual is rated at 2324 mpg for the freeway the engine runs to high in the rpm to approach that feat and at 90 mph i know it wont come even close to 24 turbo 4s are fun but not economical when matched to lousy gearing    scoobies are fun but theyre not on the level of entry lux cars by any stretch,blueguydotcom
817,April 2005,…that the subaru gt and subaru xt have sloppy suspensions especially the latter which also has incredibly slow and numb steering even the subaru configuration trumps them handily imo ironic since they raised the ride height the drivesubaru46s subies are the subarus subaru xt is the best compromise if you need utility,designman
818,April 2005,actually i couldnt disagree more the shifter is snappy and crisp the suspension is taut and the car takes off like greased lightning faster than any other car in this thread it holds the road on par with the infinitix3 i agree it does not have the amenities and the vehicle does have a numb spot in the steering but it begs for more and you can give it more and it inspires the same confidence as the bmw and it cost 10k less than the other vehicles in this board    i agree you give up some the interior of the scooby isnt up to the interior quality of these vehicles but you pay less get less amenities but more drive    as for the gas mileage in this part of the country you dont fly around at 80 unless you want a big fat ticket so im not worried but people i know who have the car get 27 doing around 65 and thats just fine with me and did i mention it cost less than the other vehicles in this segment    im not promoting the vehicle nor do i really believe it belongs in this thread imho it has the guts to compete with these other fine cars at a different level maybe less luxury and amenities but it will blow the doors off of them to some people thats important to others its not there is no right or wrong ymmv,kdshapiro
819,April 2005,did i mention the scoobies all come standard with lsd    ot,kdshapiro
820,April 2005,remember the econ 101 concept of marginal utility thats where the entry level luxury sedans come up short in my opinion lets face it most of us do most of our driving in rather routine commuting those of us in the midwest dont have many exciting roads to drive unlike much of the west and east coast    i started my search looking at tls acuraes and pontiac5s then the scottish hertitage kicked in and i asked myself why should i pay 30k for my 8 mile city commute i just couldnt rationalize it i ended up with a toyota sev6 not as luxurious as the the tl or es330 although same powertrain as the latter not as fast as the pontiac5 not sporty as the bmw but for me the marginal utility of that extra 710000 just wasnt there its luxurious and fast enough for me though obviously for many of you it isnt,lmacmil
821,April 2005,im off to see the new 3series at soldier field chicago tuesday should be fun    m,merc1
822,April 2005,designman  in terms of handling the only car that can be considered to be more poised is the bmw 330i driving the old gen subaru on twisty mountain roads was pure fun the new subaru gt with power can hold its own with any of the cars in this segment its known for having one of the most stable driving feel on bumpy roads,buddhabman
823,April 2005,bumpy roads and sport suspensions are like oil and water so if a subaru gt is good in that environment it is testament to its soft suspension151ability to absorb shock i will agree to disagree with you on this and i find that the reviews overrated it considerably,designman
824,April 2005,bumpy roads and sport suspensions are like oil and water so if a subaru gt is good in that environment it is testament to its soft suspension    my 330 was great in that environment does it have a soft suspension    i havent test driven the subaru but test drove the subaru and subaru maybe they arent up to bmw standards but for many  less they are darn close,kdshapiro
825,April 2005,147my 330 was great in that environment does it have a soft suspension148    sorry to have to tell you this your 330 is not great in that environment,designman
826,April 2005,bumpy roads and sport suspensions are like oil and water so if a subaru gt is good in that environment it is testament to its soft suspension151ability to absorb shock i will agree to disagree with you on this and i find that the reviews overrated it considerably    totally agree with your last statement,blueguydotcom
827,April 2005,do you live in nj have you driven on our roads    the subarusubaru330 had the same amount of teeth jarring which i found perfectly acceptable given the sporty nature of the cars conclusion the suspensions of these vehicles have the same tautness with the 330 naturally being the best tuned,kdshapiro
828,April 2005,doesn146t matter where you drive the subaru gt handles like a boat whether it146s the atlantic or indian ocean subaru has a much tighter suspension forget about the subaru its not even on the map in the handling category leads me to believe that like the subaru you havent driven it,designman
829,April 2005,hmm you may be right about the subaru i dont think i drove it i drove the subaru my impression was it was more trucky like ive driven so many they all blend in but surely the subaru xt will not outhandle a sedan but for what it is silky smooth shifter power galore with the turbo taut suspension spacious crossover 53 to 60 lsd and  less than an x3 its a perfect vehicle for some heck itll blow past an fx45 can you tell i had a blast driving it the cabin noise from the windup of the turbo is right on the money although it clearly does not belong in the entry level segment as the amenities are not up to others in the segment its a lot of bang for the buck    and finally for those who dwell on such things its reliable and it got the iihs best pick comparing it against a 330 no its not all that but you know what its 15k less and subaru scrimped in the amenities not the engine handling or drivetrain,kdshapiro
830,April 2005,i need to make a purchasing decision in the next few days i have narrowed the field down to two an infiniti pontiac5 rwd sedan or a subaru subaru gt ltd wagon i can get either car for 500 over invoice via the costco progdodge and the two cars are within a couple of hundred dollars of each other with the options i want    for the pontiac5 i opt for rwd because i live in the california where there is no real need for awd id go with the at because i feel the pontiac5 accelarate more smoothly with the at while the infiniti is a bit notchy and also less practical for my daily commute    for the subaru i opt for the wagon because i love the oversize sunroof and the wagon is a bit roomier and also looks a bit nice my personal opinion unfortunately the at does not work well with the 25 turbo in the subaru and the 5mt with sti short throw shifter and momo shift knob is so much fun to drive that it reminds me of a mazda miata so i think id go with the mt for the subaru    now the questions    1 my wife is a bit concerned about the durability of turbo engine as we plan to keep our car for a long time we kept our last two cars for 1015 years is this a good enough reason to stay away from the subaru    2 how is the predicted reliability of subaru compared to infiniti this is our no 1 priority so far we only have experience with honda and toyota which have been pretty much trouble free can i expect the same level of quality and reliability from subaru or infinitinissan    3 is 500 over invoice a good price for these cars is it worth bargaining for a price that is significantly better than costcos    your help is most appreciated thanks,jcj1
831,April 2005,some thoughts    1 cars with turbos in the long run are probably less problem free than cars without in 15 years who can tell what the reliability of a turbo car is but in 15 years what will be the reliability of the pontiac5    2 you can get a lot of reliability information from the annual car buyers issue of consumer reports you can read the subaru and infiniti forums for some honda as to the types of issues people are experiencing    3 i would starting negotiating under invoice and work my way up rather than to work my way down    good luck,kdshapiro
832,April 2005,in 7 years of ownership the only major outofpocket expense on my audi 18t was a turborelated repair that cost me about 600 so take that for what its worth but it is one reason why i downgraded the saab 93 as a replacement for the audi i just didnt want another turbo for longterm ownership ended up with a 325i look under the hood and youll see a lot of extra plumbing sensors controls etc that are related to the turbo and the thought of something in there spinning at 20k rpm for years and years makes me cringe ,gordonwd
833,April 2005,back in the 1980s when chrysler was the largest producer of turbocharged engines in the world i had not one but two of their cars both were running strong at 100000 miles when i traded them in and i had no doubt that they would have continued to provide me with excellent service had i decided to keep them having said that within my immediate sphere of family and friends there were five other mopar turbos that i was aware of and each one of them required a turbo replacement within the first 75000 miles one needed two turbo replacements the only difference that i could figure was that while we all followed the standard maintenance plan i used mobil1 while the rest of them used whatever oil their dealership happened to use    i switched to mobil1 from castrolgtx when i got my first turbo simply because id heard of bearing issues due to the oil being coked when the oil supply was abruptly cut off from the hothigh speed turbine bearings at engine shutdown i reasoned that the synthetic oil would be much more capable of resisting coking and while my sampling of two isnt definitive it was enough to cause me to use nothing but mobil1 in every car ive had since then    best regards  shipo,shipo
834,April 2005,and on my audi turbo they had a recommended oilchange interval of 5000 miles vs 7500 miles for the 30 v6 model of the same car even with that i heard that there were some issues with engine problems caused by the coking up of the oil if it was not changed on time or a substandard grade was used i got a letter from audi regarding this a few months after i had sold the car fortunately i sold it to a friend of mine down the street so was able to pass on the warning to him,gordonwd
835,April 2005,i havnt seen much input on the small mecedes sedan the c230 supercharged etc    does any on have any input on this one especially compared to bmw 325 and audi audi    thanks,squirtdad
836,April 2005,heres my two cents i test drove two 05 c230s back in november one was a sport coupe with an automatic the other was a sport sedan w6 speed manual i drove the auto first and was dismayed by the noticeable lag on take off the 6 speed on the other hand had no noticeable lag and i couldnt tell the difference between it and a normally aspirated six as far as the shifter goes it was silky smooth quick and short the road holding was good but a little softer than im used to though not as soft as mbs reputation for a soft ride     i had no intention of buy an automatic its just that they didnt have any sticks on the lot when i went looking    youre welcome    ps for what its worth i wound up buying a 05 325i zsp in january never drove the audi  i have an aversion to fwd,potemkin
837,April 2005,i just sold my 04 subaru and got an 05 pontiac5x  the subaru is something like 227hp the subaru is 250hp with half a litre more displacement  4cyl vs 6cyl you are going to be reving that subaru above 3k to keep it in the powerband the low end is real hard to find with the subaru  the subaru manual transmission is like shifting a tractor    i always felt like i was racing and working hard while driving the subaru i just push the pedal and cruise along with the pontiac5 power is always there when you need it    johni,twodogjohnny
838,April 2005,i understand and am not debating that point i was only pointing out that after a test drive or two i understand why there is almost a cult like following for the cars they are not entry level luxos but the drivetrain is beyond reproach and the shifter is silky smooth    the subaru for example was clocked at 53 to 60 by cd with only 210 hp like the bimmers these cars are sleepers but again i realize the luxury factor is not up to their bigger cousins,kdshapiro
839,April 2005,thats the problem with getting into the luxury segment you get spoiled by all the features that you did quite well without when you didnt know about them  two cars ago i owned a nissan ser that i thought was a really great car  sort of the early 90s equivalent to the subaru in being a pocketrocket sleeper type of compact car when i got my audi i suddenly woke up to all the features that i didnt have in the nissan power windows climate control great stereo and on and on    now i dont think i can go back to what now seems like a strippeddown car like the nissan and in retrospect even my audi seems like it was lacking compared to my 325i how did i ever get along without memory power seats  and i just read a road test the other day of a car in this segment and the reviewer knocked it down because it had heated seats but no heated steering wheel if you can believe that,gordonwd
840,April 2005,i agree 98 after living with a 3 series for a few years i got very spoiled i like the extra luxo stuff no doubt however i realized the loaded subaru would be quite acceptable to me as would the subaru xt premium i do want the power this power that heated this and automatic that and leather    i found out dont need a premium brand and i can gracefully step down the luxo factor and still like the car    with the additional requirement for more cars in the family im thinking through the difference between what is wanted and what is needed,kdshapiro
841,May 2005,hi al    im in the boston area with an 05 nonnav tl bridgestone turanza el42 tires they are the worst tires in the snow that ive experienced in almost 30 years of driving at least that i remember i got through this past snowy winter with the aid of all the traction electronics common snowdriving sense and luck we took the wifes rx300 on our few ski trips but if i was going to regularly take my tl to me nh vt etc i would definately buy four snows or at the very least upgrade to a much better snow performing allseason    in addition i believe these tires flat spot maybe that s a characteristic of low profile tires which is a bit annoying other than that they seem ok if you get a nav model or infiniti i think youll get different tires which others would have to comment on snowwise    other than the tires im really enjoying the tl applied three coats of zaino on sunday the abyss blue looks great  13 jaguar xf possibly my favorite of all the cars ive owned but my 09 jag xk was a beauty as was my 05 acura tl 88 acura acura 84 mitsubishi mirage turbo  78 volkswagen scirocco my first and of course the 92 nissan nissan ser and 95 saab 900s i bought for the ex ok i like a lot of the cars in my life,laurasdada
842,May 2005,tst good post its funny i bought my tl over the pontiac5x because i found the tl to be much smoother quieter ride and nicer interior stylematerials not to mention the superior exterior style of the tl    probably a more apples to apples comparison would have been the rl to the bmw5 but luckily we both made the right choice in our purchases congrats enjoy the m it really is a nice piece of work infinitis on a roll  13 jaguar xf possibly my favorite of all the cars ive owned but my 09 jag xk was a beauty as was my 05 acura tl 88 acura acura 84 mitsubishi mirage turbo  78 volkswagen scirocco my first and of course the 92 nissan nissan ser and 95 saab 900s i bought for the ex ok i like a lot of the cars in my life,laurasdada
843,May 2005,always show the frontal and side views of the m and never a rear angle shot    hmmmmm,billyperks
844,May 2005,i bought the pontiac5x over the tl for a couple of reasons nav was not important to me since i have an aftermarket garmin that suits my purposes i feel that the pontiac5 has a roomier interior i also liked the all wheel drive functionality for the winter but that it is all but off when you dont need it making the car feel like a rear driver i grew up driving rear drive vehicles and i just prefer them the wife drives a saab 93 aero convertible and its a great machine but the torque steer while minimized is still annoying its really splitting hairs here these are both fabulous cars it amazes me that the manufacturers have improved so much over the years what a great time to be buying cars i hope everyone enjoys their purchase whatever it may be,esfoad
845,May 2005,i feel that the pontiac5 has a roomier interior    thats odd because i came to the exact opposite conclusion i think the pontiac5 is taller and narrower and has a bit more rearseat leg room than the tl but the rearseat headroom on the tl i found much better i know you can recline the gs back seat but i found it to be uncomfortable when reclined    as far as space is concerned the tl felt wider roomier more like a pontiac compared to the pontiac5 which i felt was similar to a pontiac the 2 pontiacs were my last 2 cars before the tl    i wish the tl had better storage compartments though,aaargh
846,May 2005,i agree with you regarding the tl feeling roomier than the g i bet the measurements are similar but some aspect just makes the g feel more closedin to me maybe its as simple as the fact that the pontiac5 i drove had a black interior  that couldve made it seem smaller    regardless im happy with the tl and not sure what other storage space you would want aaargh weve got side door sill pockets that expand a bilevel center console thats so deep they added a light to it rear seatbacks a little flipout drawer in the back of the center console closableconcealable cupholders 2 drawers in the centerstack maybe more if you dont have nav and a decentsized glove box only thing i can figure is you want a sunglassholder in the roof or a drawer under the dash on the left side overall i think theres a lot of storage space,ljwalters1
847,June 2005,i guess its each to hisher own regarding space they must be very similar once again they are both great cars the tl is on everybodys best buy list and the pontiac5 is constantly compared to the bmw 3 series i think either choice is a good one,esfoad
848,June 2005, pontiac5 can get you otd for 30000 and the tl for about 34000 plus bmw dealers wont bargain    au contraire the dealer i spoke to seemed willing to sell me a 330i for 1500 over euro invoice 330metallic paintwinter package  xenons suroof logic 7 sterio etc standard   500 cca discount  34000     in addition 90 of my driving is highway so a tl automatic seems like the logical choice    what i thought city driving was the reason people try to excuse their laziness    dave,dhanley
849,June 2005,i cant justify the price of the 330i when the pontiac5 can get you otd for 30000 and the tl for about 34000 plus bmw dealers wont bargain    huh thats just not true about bmw dealers being unwilling to haggle furthermore if you really want savings get the 3 series via ed 45k off msrp an e90 330i outfitted with leather sport metallica paint is about 35k before 1k dealer profit,blueguydotcom
850,June 2005,i went for a test ride for both the pontiac5 and the tl and found the tll way more quieter than the infiniti i loved the interior of pontiac5 and the price too  the only deterrent was the noice level it was just too much noice for the money  i wanted a quiet car for all this money    the dealer callled me today and mentioned that the car i did the test drive had a sports package fitted on it and that was the probable cause fro the noise he has asked me to drive one with the standard option    what do you suggest is it going to be any different that what i have experienced or is the sports package designed to hear the vrooooooommmmmmm  suggestions will be appreciated,sid3
851,June 2005,you should drive them back to back to get a good comparison the audio memory is very short so if you drive them even a day apart you might not be able to tell the difference the sport package adds stiffer suspension but im not sure that it would change the exhaust note,lmacmil
852,June 2005,i drove all three with automatics on an autocross course last year heres my take    pontiac5 the muscle car of the bunch powerful thirsty noisier engine the car the folks running the event told me after my lap to keep it down it will power slide in a heartbeat would be the fastest with a good driver who could maximize its engine potential enough interior room to scare 4 other people along with the driver    tl the luxury bargain of this class plowed in hard turns but a comfortable ride and a roomy luxurious and quiet interior the one for a highway road trip with 4 passengers fast enough to merge on any chevroletway but not adept on a tightturning course    330i i havent driven the e90 yet but the e46 platform was the balanced sport sedan faster for me on the track because of the smooth power even braking and outstanding handling made me look smooth going flat out best for a 2 person car with occasional rear seat passengers,jamesspot
853,June 2005,i dont recall whether it was in this forum or the pontiac5 forum but i heard others complain about noise and some posters said they should check the tire pressure before the test drive apparently cars are shipped with higher than normal air pressure and the dealerships often forget to let some air out of the tires these posters blamed road noise and a harsher ride on this issue,ljwalters1
854,June 2005,you are right about tire pressure my car was delivered with high air pressure however i dont understand why people here complain about the noise level of the pontiac5 the growl of the engine is one of the nicest sounding factory systems on the planetlink title for me its one of the enticing features of the sport sedan if you want quiet buy an es330 or an toyota,esfoad
855,June 2005,i actually enjoyed the engine growl when i tested the pontiac5x it was the wind and road noise that helped tip the scale in the tls favor for me  13 jaguar xf possibly my favorite of all the cars ive owned but my 09 jag xk was a beauty as was my 05 acura tl 88 acura acura 84 mitsubishi mirage turbo  78 volkswagen scirocco my first and of course the 92 nissan nissan ser and 95 saab 900s i bought for the ex ok i like a lot of the cars in my life,laurasdada
856,June 2005,for me its one of the enticing features of the sport sedan if you want quiet buy an es330 or an toyota    my 330i with performance package will growl at wot but at a steady 8090 the cars engine and exhaust is quiet additionally the engine noise is nice and sounds like something impressive is happening under the hood in the pontiac5 i felt the engine was abraisive uneven and transmitted lots of nvh above 4k the engine made a terrible racket and the tranny sent way too much garbage through my arm  like driving an old american 4 cylinder,blueguydotcom
857,June 2005,i never tested the 330i so i cant report on it but i did extensive tests between the tl and the pontiac5x i didnt notice a large difference in nvh between the two the engine is defenitely louder in the pontiac5x i guess i was swayed some by the all wheel drive in the pontiac5x also my car is an automatic so the shifter vibration is a non issue,esfoad

859,June 2005,i was wondering it looks like bmw has a very weak engine 25 for  the same price 30000 pontiac5 cts or anything  what is the great deal about 25l 184hp 175lb 2005 model   this power seems extremely weak almost volkswagen volkswagen power  is the ride really that good worth 30k  im thinking about pontiac5 cts vs 325 around 30k  thanks in advance    thedrak,draknad

863,June 2005,i have not drivin one but i think i will  but im thinking is it really worth 2x as much as a volkswagen with the same power  or im thinking test drive vs owning is different plus i really dont think  a bmw will drivefeel that much better then a pontiac5 cts  30k can get 400 hp 300 hp at least  200 hp and luxury as well  since we are speaking performance i have to really drive to see  if 184hp is really worth the 30k  performancevalue vs 300hp or 250hp  interesting  thanks    thedrak    actually now that i think about it  184hp for 30k performance  sounds silly almost ludicrous,draknad
864,June 2005,the drive of the pontiac5 is unrefined compared to the 3 series 298 hp does not equal superior handling over the bmw but this of course does not mean one would not want a cts pontiac5 tl acura etc over the 3 series then again some people chose the 325 over the pontiac5 because they dig the better overall road feel and handling,kdshapiro
865,June 2005,310 hp 280 lbft of torque could be the a rocket but how will it handle    well lexus made the lexus handle extremely well so if they choose to they can surely make it handle with that sweet engine hopefully they get the gearing down more than they did with the old lexus    so at this point i am more concerned about two things with the new is can they restrain the electronic nanny enough to make it fun but most of all even if they get everything right what will they decide to charge i fear lexus has realized they have some brand cachet to bank on    enjoy cybersol,cybersol
866,June 2005,not adding much but my 2¢  i agree with the posting 3496 jamesspot and with the concerns of posting 3934 sid3 imo the pontiac5 handles very well and comparing the price and reliability issues to a 330i i was seriously considering one however when testing it out i found the noise level unacceptable for me and would never buy it on that issue alone  im not a twenty year old the tl is just as jamesspot reviewed  he described my brothers driving style perfectly my brother is a retired banker and he loves the car i recently purchased a cpo bmwc for my wife  she loves the convertible im looking forward to testing out the lexus350 i liked the lexus performancehandling a lot but it was a little small and boy racer for me if the new one handles close to the bmw and with a competitive price id sell my 540ia for one  regardless all these cars are great  were fortunate to have so much choice,equan
867,June 2005,why has bmw resisted going to a 35 liter engine the numbers from bmw new engines are impressive but the competition is moving up to 35 liters    some thoughts    1 they are trying to keep the power in the engines commesurate with the overall line up and the introduction of a 35l would throw everything off    2 they want their gas guzzlers to be the big 8 cylinder engines comparing the 35l in the pontiac5 to the old 3l in the e46 a friend who has a simliar commute as me gets 17 mpg where i get 24 one cant have it both ways a bigger engine that is thrifty on gas but long on performance unless they play with the gearing one can probably expect realworld numbers to be inline with the pontiac5    3 the heavier engine throws off the delicate balance of the car    4 a 35 engine would not substantially make the car faster people who post in the forums constantly say the pontiac5 feels much faster than the 330i but the stats as quoted in the magazines over the years dont really bear that out,kdshapiro
868,June 2005,kd good points and    i think part of the engine sizepower has to do with an auto makers philosophy ford bmw and honda all seem to subscribe to selling well dont change it for years ford top selling ford sported a massive 160 hp and a stump pullin 160 lbs of torque 4 ltr engine it sold well why change it in general the big three tend to follow this model with ford being the most conservative honda is another example i think that bmw follows this as well    also why do we need more and more these automakers have all done well with the we dont need more fill in the blank to compete philosophy they take what they have and refine and polish when we bought our nissan we looked at the ford and liked a lot of the features many of them very simple like the ability to fold the rear seats without taking the headrests off our honda is a much more thought out car than our nissan ill be sad to see it go,kasperghost
869,June 2005,why has bmw resisted going to a 35 liter engine the numbers from bmw new engines are impressive but the competition is moving up to 35 liters    other than the pontiac5 who else in this class has a 35 liter engine tl is at 32 audi is 18 to 30 lexus es is 33 mercedes benz cclass is 2432 now that theyve tweaked the 3 liter to 255 hp why bother with another configuration    i think the pontiac5 is geared lower than most of the competition which is how it gets its slight acceleration advantage but fuel economy suffers if you look at the road test stats the g is turned at lot higher rpm than most of the competition at highway speeds,lmacmil
870,June 2005,other than the pontiac5 who else in this class has a 35 liter engine tl is at 32 audi is 18 to 30 lexus es is 33 mercedes benz cclass is 2432    well not quite the new c and e class mercedes benz are available with a 35 liter v6 and the new lexus is is going to be available with either a 25 liter or a 35 liter v6    best regards  shipo,shipo
871,June 2005,insert a key into the ignition and turn the key insert the fob into the slot push the botton whats the diff and who cares the driving is the thing,bookman2
872,June 2005,no even if you dont add coupeconvertiblewagon numbers the 3 series sedan was still the sales leader in this category with 8175 units sold in may,jrock65
873,June 2005,obviously someone like blueguydotcom cares i would care as well    so does bmw or else they wouldnt offer the smart access package    these are sports sedans with some luxury luxury means the little things    driving is not the only thing if so why bother with a stereo leather power seats power windows ac etc,jrock65
874,June 2005,thats my point without tl competition how many tl owners would have bought bmw 10 years ago i think many market share is the point and bmw no longer dominates like it used to the bmw label means a lot to many but acura and infiniti are cutting into bmw sales    no way the kind of person that likes the current tl would have turned his nose up at the far more spartan and crude e36 3 series,blueguydotcom
875,June 2005,i believe most people select cars based on appearance and reputation in that order most people never drive their cars hard enough to tell the difference between these cars from a performance perspective i owned a 2001 325ci and i will be picking up my new pontiac5 6 speed friday the bmw handles better but only at the limit i also have a bmw z3 30i and a miata the miata autocrosses better than any of my other cars i speed up for turns  i would probably have purchased the accura tl if it had rear wheel drive i think its the best looking of the three cars unfortunately although ive owned some front wheel drive cars i find them very unsatisfyining to drive near the limit too much understeer in the corners and torque steer during acceleration  the infiniti blessed with rear wheel drive is only a little behind the accura tl in appearance and well ahead of the bmw 3 series when the last bmw generation came out i couldnt order one fast enough the new style leaves me cold additionally to get comparable performance from a bmw id need to get the 30 engine and spend a whole lot more than for the infiniti  when i test drive a car i usually scare the salesperson and ive tried all three cars i like them all in different ways but when it came down to my personal tastes the infiniti was the best all around package for me unfortunately infiniti makes very few 12 6 speeds so ive had to wait almost two months for my special order  all three of these cars are excellent vehicles you will enjoy whatever you select,perunest
876,June 2005,cool someone agrees  additionally to get comparable performance from a bmw id need to get the 30 engine and spend a whole lot more than for the infiniti    most people never drive their cars hard enough to tell the difference between these cars from a performance perspective,draknad
877,June 2005,your point is well taken and bmw has a broad market its attempting to satisfy however my point is that when one adds up the attributes of an infinity audi and a bmw before making the determination about which to buy it would seem that the entry system would rank rather low when compared to the vehicles actual performance on the road,bookman2
878,June 2005,if we were all to forget about the valueprice factor which car would you really buy or would have bought    if the tl 3 series and pontiac5 were all priced at 30k w all the bells and whistles then it would come down to pure driving experience wouldnt it    personally i went with the pontiac5 mainly for the driving dyamics and that the base 06 beemer didnt even have power seats moonroof standard but no power seats even on the drivers side    if they were priced the same though id have to say im 51pontiac5 49bmw    anyone else,jsamson
879,June 2005,but i did drive my aunts 04 honda sedan which is the same as a tl just kidding frisconick    lol,frisconick
880,June 2005,for example the honda in japan is smaller than the american model    in fact the japaneseeuropean honda is what is sold here as the acura acura and i was considering that car before i decided instead on my bmw 325i but im still looking at it as a good possibility for my wifes next car,gordonwd
881,June 2005,i think that the main reason for us and elsewhere bmw sales being down in the early months of this year has a simple explanation the 3 series is far and away the biggest seller for bmw  a large percentage of their sales and since at least the first of the year if not sooner everyone who knows anything about bmw has known that the new car would be out in the aprilmay timefdodgee so the sales downturn was probably due in a large part to people waiting for the e90 to come out the reduced sales might continue for a while yet as others wait for the other versions of the e90 to start arriving here the 325 ix models etc    once bmw gets the full range of e90s into production and on the lots i would guess that their sales will be right back on target,gordonwd
882,June 2005,i would certainly pick the bmw if all had the same equipment at the same price but they dont i posted this in another forum    i test drove the 325 and the 330 yesterday and they were excellent vehicles i really dont think i would want to be in any other car when im approaching a sharp turn at high speeds however i doubt ill be driving that way most of the time especially since its my car also pricing does mean something to me i configured the 325 and the pontiac5 on their websites similarly equipped the msrp for the 325 was 40400 and for the g was 35800 a price difference of 4600 the bmw does have bluetooth which is important to me however i dont know i can justify the price difference to myself especially knowing i can deal significantly on the pontiac5 i expect the real world price difference between these vehicles would be close to 67 k after the deals were done    does anyone know if there will be any changes to the 2006 gs will bluetooth be available    i configured both cars with most options except nav system,ckelly14
883,June 2005,oh come on get her a tl,frisconick
884,June 2005,its fun but silly to think about what youd buy if all cars cost the same and had the same features might as well consider what youd buy if all cars had the same handling and performance certainly the 3 series would be at the bottom of your list bc its the smallest of the 3 and cost the most if they all performed the same id think the tl would have to be the main choice bc its fwd is better on wet roads and its navigation is 2nd only to the infiniti m,ljwalters1
885,June 2005,if they all performed the same id think the tl would have to be the main choice bc its fwd is better on wet roads and its navigation is 2nd only to the infiniti m    ummm i think not if anything the tl is the worst of the three on wet roads why its fwd related torque steer which is only a problem at the highest of power settings on dry roads becomes and absolute nightmare when accelerating from a stop and turning at the same time or when acceleratingclimbing a hill on a curve no thanks give me rwd any day    best regards  shipo,shipo
886,June 2005,i bought a bmw 3 recently for no other reasons than 147i want a bmw148 i really don146t care if a tl or a pontiac5 is a better car or not i drive a bmw,oliverx
887,June 2005,i bought my 325i in january because i bought a 318ti back in august of 1995 ten years on and that ti still drives like new over those ten years it had one mechanical failure the ignition switch went bad apart from the usual wearandtear items batteries tires etc i hated the idea of trading it in so much that i put off buying a new car for as long as i could then it hit me buy a new car and dont trade in the ti    i came close to buying a mb c230 late last year but the deal fell through i looked at the pontiac5 but they told me the manuals wouldnt be out until february i considered the lexus but no dealers in my area had any manuals in stock and none of them had any on order nor were they planning on adding any to their inventory ever    the acura and audi are fwd    the bmw was pretty much the only choice    id gone seven years without a car payment now i have two bmw and i still dont have a car payment    besides the 3series isnt a rebadged 350z or honda and the lexuss tail looks an awful lot like a toyota to me,potemkin
888,June 2005,new to the forum but heres my opinion  recently i had a chance to drive the bmw 330i acura tl and pontiac5 it was in a large parking lot with acres of cones set up  we had a chance to drive them as hard as we wanted backtobacktoback several times  now ill preface this by saying i know that you are not going to hop off the interstate only to find yourself in a 300 ft slalom through cones leading into a 180degree hairpin but  the tls front end could not be controlled i couldnt dive into a corner and accelerate out otherwise a few cones would find themselves lodged underneath the front end sure the interior was nice and it was a rather large car  the pontiac5 was powerful takeoff speed was great but when it came to turning the car backandforth the body roll was horrible it took a few laps just to be able to predict where the thing was going to straighten up and hopefully hit the right line  that is what i loved about the bmw 330i it was predictable precise i was always in control the power was there the handling was there steering was tighter  it was a better allaround car in that situation  granted when we took them on the interstate all felt solid at 80mph  so a lot will have to do with looks and price im sure but one thing not being taken into account here is maintenance  sure the japanese cars which lets face it are honda and nissan will not cost as much to maintain but bmw is free anyway i think you have to figure that in when you are doing price comparisons  any response is appreciated and ive really enjoyed reading everyones opinion during the last few days,bmw3434
889,June 2005,came close to buying 06 325i but went with a rebadged 350z wfour doors    and sure i was aware of the fact that part of the benefits of driving a bmw is being able to say i drive a bmw but after a couple test drives went with the pontiac5 which arguably hondaing to some magazines surpassed the previous generation 3 series in driving dynamics ultimately its an individual choice i used to drive a rebadged toyota toyota before the pontiac5    and ive never mistaken a toyota for an lexus,jsamson
890,June 2005,i wish i would have been there  just like everyone has an opinion with a cars exterior design interior appointments etc driving dyamics can be quite subjective as well  ive driven both a 325i and pontiac5 and the difference in the handling is quite striking but unlike you ive never driven them through acres of cones     i guess what im trying to say is that as far as comparisons go motor trend cd edmunds have endless resources when it comes to testing every aspect of a car but yet they come up with different conlusions i was somewhat steered by the fact that it seemed like most magazines favored the pontiac5 over the previous generation 3 seriesbut in contrast to that edmunds did a comparo a few years ago where a previous generation 03 tl s type beat the 03 pontiac5,jsamson
891,June 2005,i was somewhat steered by the fact that it seemed like most magazines favored the pontiac5 over the previous generation 3 series  i would agree the e46 certainly lacked the power and overall room of the pontiac5 plus the pontiac5 certainly would attract the eye more than say a 325i  yet some folks like and always will like the lowkey styling of the e46 i still love the styling of the early90s coupe,bmw3434
892,June 2005,any body have an input on their experience especially in drivinghandling with the infiniti i am looking at bmw325i but some how my eye get drawn to the mbeven though i know the recent rep for quality is not good,squirtdad
893,June 2005,i really don’t care if a tl or a pontiac5 is a better car or not i drive a bmw    i dont so im probably not worthy    your statement however is part of the reason,cdnpinhead
894,June 2005,when i drove both they handled better than you could ever resonably push them on the street anywayboth are great driving cars that you have to nit pick apart as it isthe thing is the bmw doesnt accelerate hard enough to really excite meand lets face it you can stomp on it when you pass on the highway or on entrance dodgeps alot more often then you will ever safely test its handling limitsin this respect the infinity is a great choice,grove4
895,June 2005,i have to second thati have driven a 325i and a tl back to back through cones and that alone put me off of the tl i just couldnt use any power in corners i thought even the fwd 93 was significantly better in this respect    now most people dont care about this degree of atthelimit handling and if it handles an entrance dodgep hard its fine so for them the tl is probably better,dhanley
896,June 2005,j i was just joshn with those rebadge comments    if it wasnt for a timing issue id probably be driving a pontiac5 coupe infiniti right now i certainly dont think theres anything wrong with picking the pontiac5 its a superb automobile if youre happy with it thats all that matters the lexus is also a worthy car i wouldnt seriously criticize anyone for choosing any of these cars    by the way i didnt buy either bmw because theyre bmw that was somebody else i bought them because i thought they were the best cars that fit my needs at the time i bought them,potemkin
897,June 2005,and sure i was aware of the fact that part of the benefits of driving a bmw is being able to say i drive a bmw    not a benefit in my eyes the worst part of owning a bmwthat damned name and logo on the car,blueguydotcom
898,June 2005,i was somewhat steered by the fact that it seemed like most magazines favored the pontiac5 over the previous generation 3 seriesbut in contrast to that edmunds did a comparo a few years ago where a previous generation 03 tl s type beat the 03 pontiac5    why were you steered by other peoples opinions    regardless the pontiac5 when pressed to the edge will snap were not talking a little oversteerthe car will sawp ends rather suddenly i know because it happened to me the editor here on edmunds mentioned on his board that he had that happen to him too other mags bring it up and then move on as if its no big deal maybe i push my cars harder than most but i dont like the idea of a car hopping or skipping sideways on my suddenly,blueguydotcom
899,June 2005,maybe i push my cars harder than most but i dont like the idea of a car hopping or skipping sideways on my suddenly    hehe i was always told that if i didnt occasionally get the car i was driving to swap ends i wasnt driving hard enough     best regards  shipo,shipo
900,June 2005,as a matter of fact i test drove one back in november i thought the handling was fine not as soft as i was lead to believe but quite comfortable id add that the infiniti is a must i also drove an automatic and there was a noticeable lag coming off the line that simply wasnt detectable with the manual    as far as quality the quality is fine its the reliability thats being questioned as far as that goes you might want to skip on the bellsandwhistles they just increase the number of things that can go wrong    oh and the shifting was smooth and precise  better than any of the others i was testing at the time,potemkin
901,June 2005,sign up on the bmw web site or call the phone number and see for yourself i drove the e90 330i pontiac5 and audi 32 audi on a closed course in atlanta last friday i had driven a similar lexus event a year ago told my professional race car driver instructor to tell me to keep it down if i was too aggressive he never said boo  but i figured i was braking at the proper time when his foot hit the passenger floor board at the same time mine went for the brake    observations all cars were automatics    audi  heavy and understeering must be hammered with tires squealing trusting in the awd to drag you out of corners    pontiac5  a beast good power and unforgiving handling transmission drops back to idle when you come off the gas leading to delays in getting the power back down    new 330i  an amazingly balanced sport sedan a smoother ride and more room than my 04 active steering on an autocross course was telepathic brakes engine step transmission in sports mode and suspension all in sync    did a hot lap with the pro at the wheel  shifted the bmw steptronic transmission manually and left it in second and followed the line  woohoo    feed back on my driving  needed to use the full width of the course side to side for the most speed through the cones i also tended to either go full throttle or braking vice a graduated release of the throttle  application of the brakes as the steering input comes in and then the reverse as it comes out    a great experience to drive all three cars all out at a slow speed 50ish autocross limit on a 1 mile closed course    anyone else done this,jamesspot

903,June 2005,can146t yet compare preidrive bmw reliability with the current generation for one thing those with the japanesecar mentality need their consumer reports red dots they avoid german cars like the plague there are a lot of black dots showing up next to bmw these days bmw free maintenance notwithstanding it is an inconvenience to bring the car in for multiple software glitches and such in addition i am not convinced that the service bays have a handle on these problems yet you hear plenty of stories around here about bmw service departments not having a clue what gives with current electronics a colleague of mine has a 7 she loves the car but can146t wait to turn it in off lease because of the electronic issues    so yeah it146s nice to have it made in the shade with those luscious older bimmers but in the words of financial disclosures past performance does not guarantee the future the reason i bought my previousgeneration bmw is yesterday146s news since bmw was so hellbent on change i too am changing my criteria for future purchases,designman

913,June 2005,i guess to repeat for blind eyes  fwd vs rwd  325 is rwd  acura is fwd which outperformed many rwds bmw 325  which is the point of post 3736  just to repeat fwd outperform rwd cars    but the funny thing is you admit you would not think about gettting bmw 325i  which is a bmw that many in here are considering vs pontiac5s or others  since to repeat 3608 330 cost too much to be considered    nother funny thing you should know is a 325 in racing form  does not have the same engine or hp as the one youd get from the in factory    im not sure why you cant seem to follow  dont hate were all lovers not haters haha    i hated that car i,draknad
914,June 2005,those with the japanesecar mentality need their consumer reports red dots they avoid german cars like the plague there are a lot of black dots showing up next to bmw these days lol thats me    however lets be fair the 3 series got a thumbs up this year,frisconick
915,June 2005,fwd outperform rwd cars    in this instance you may be correct i dont know enough about the racing situation to say otherwise couple of things that could be factors  acura et all needs street creds that bmw already has and doesnt feel the need to through the money into this series if you notice many of the bmw listed in the race series are no longer manufactured    please cite proof salaries win loss place on different platforms of the drivers would be a start    what a way to build sales beat bmw in such and such situation    name a nonhomogolation series where the builder had a choice of rwd vs fwd platform and purpose built a fwd    name a make and model of fwd car that is considered a sports car classic there are many japanese rwd classics datsun b2000  z cars to name a few cite championship results    name a major race that has been won by a fwd car nonhomogolation    please cite the physics behind the reasons that a fwd car is better than a rwd car assume we have a reasonable understanding of mass acceleration yaw etc    in general the three series does quite respectable in racing please show us a general trend in the giant world of racing that fwd kicks rwd or bmw is getting whipped by fwd machines    in closing i am not contradicting your statement that bmw is getting its tail whipped in the series you cite i am saying in general that you will have a great difficulty proving fwd is better that rwd in high performance situations,kasperghost
916,June 2005,we are thoughtful and considerate in this community professional ettiquitte is a must and brings out the best in all involved i appreciate the many profesional and constructive responses most of you post,kasperghost
917,June 2005,you are right within one set of padodgeeters but not within another i fully admit fwd will trump rwd with under 200 hp for it is more efficient but not necessarily more balanced subarus eat fwd cars for lunch at rallys look at the minicooper of course it is a niche vehicle with little use for a family of 4 but it drives great    you can take an e90 and drop a v8 in it like the rumored new bmw and then its a different story you will still have a balanced sport sedan that will get to 60 in what 5 or less seconds and do 179 or so without even breathing hard how about dropping a v8 in a acura and then running it on a racetrack think it will be balanced or it will be able to even keep up with an bmw now im just using that as an example    so yes in certain situations fwd may be preferable in certain limited types of racesrallyesevent it may even do very well against rwd vehicles with limited torque and hp,kdshapiro

922,June 2005,actually cr is not objective it still depends on people returning the filledin surveys i believe that a larger number of respondents will be people with a bone to pick someone who is satisfied with his car has less reason to respond,blueguydotcom
923,June 2005,so following that logic i guess more european eg mercedes benz car owners have bones to pick than asian car owners eg acurahonda  13 jaguar xf possibly my favorite of all the cars ive owned but my 09 jag xk was a beauty as was my 05 acura tl 88 acura acura 84 mitsubishi mirage turbo  78 volkswagen scirocco my first and of course the 92 nissan nissan ser and 95 saab 900s i bought for the ex ok i like a lot of the cars in my life,laurasdada
924,June 2005,perhaps i used to swear by cr now im not so sure i believe any of it id rather roll the dice and follow my heart than follow cool empirical numbers the sound money or logical side says buy a used camcord i cant live that way im already bored to death  cant imagine fretting over the possibility my car might break down and thus end up buying a car that doesnt make me love it or hate it passionately,blueguydotcom
925,June 2005,i guess to repeat for blind eyes  fwd vs rwd  325 is rwd  acura is fwd which outperformed many rwds bmw 325  which is the point of post 3736  just to repeat fwd outperform rwd cars    to repeat for you from my original post regarding your gleeful writing about the fwd race cars    yeah you see lots of indycart racing with fwd too right    more than that what is more fun thats the key to me    others have already hit you over the head so its not worth it you cited one race series and acted like its gospel nobody here believes you believe all race cars should be fwd,blueguydotcom
926,June 2005,over the years ive become so jaded regarding the cars that cr has recommended that id always prided myself on not ever owning a car that made their thumbs up list then what do you suppose happened the folks over there at cr took a silly pill and waxed enthusiastic all over the e39 530i wouldnt you know it i had just placed an order for that very car i almost cancelled my order almost     best regards  shipo,shipo
927,June 2005,of course if you look at the 2004 standings bmw had the top 2 3 of the top 4 and 7 0f the top 11    httpwwwworldchallengecom2004tcstandingshtml    i know nothing about this series so i have no idea how much the particular drivers abilities play into their results,cheerioboy26
928,June 2005,based on repeated reliability ratings and surveys by different sources cr jd power etc which consistently put lexus infiniti and acura over bmw mb and audi ill take my chances with an out of warranty japanese car    in determining my reliability chances with a car i wouldnt put much stock in the very limited sample of whether this friend or that friend had trouble with his japanesegerman car,jrock65
929,June 2005,i agree with the choice of your word chances thats what it is you play the percentages ive had superb german sedans and pita japanese sedans ive been a long time reader of cr yet i didnt submit any information about the pita japanese sedans or reliable german sedans    they are biased in an objective way that is difficult to measure i wont take any chances with used sedans period as i know people that have been burnt with supposedly reliable makes    if i were to buy a used sedan i would take my chances with a be cpo,kdshapiro
930,June 2005,dont think this is neccessary to repeat  but we are in entry level perf seden forum  bmw 325 330 pontiac5 cts acura  which race in that series we are talking about entry level perf sedens  fwd vs rwd i refer to entry level perf sedens entry level perf sedens entry level perf sedens  do the 330 or 325 fit in any other catagory    indy car what on earthforum are you talking about  dont think many will drive indy so its not valuable information get your details straight    btw will not respond to fwd vs rwd ne more not worth the time,draknad
931,July 2005,yes ive read such articles yet i still think id have a greater perception of more than 25 hp increase    of course theres a lot of factors torquerpm weight gearing etc    dave,dhanley
932,July 2005,bmw published number is also 61 seconds,fedlawman
933,July 2005,audi has slower published times but it felt plenty fast faster than needed for most types of city driving around here with all the radar around including photo radar,wco81
934,July 2005,each car mag have different numbers c and d have very fast numbers most under 6,frisconick
935,July 2005,i wonder if they changed the gearing from the e45 to the e90 the e45 was a bit short compared to its competitors does anyone know the e45 060 how short is the pontiac5 gearing it seemed a bit high when i drove it,kasperghost
936,July 2005,entrylevel segment of cars cost around 30k usd    it is describing the cars not the drivers if you have so much problem about it need to ask yourself why    walton the wmart founder drove an old pickup he didnt need to put affordability into words he didnt worry about it    btw objectively an average one can afford a car means the cost of the car is about x of his overall asset that x can vary by person can be 000001 for walton but better dont be over 30    car doesnt make a person to make it short,ctl
937,July 2005,oh i agree 100 with you as it was pointed out to me it is merely a marketing ploy and i agree with that point too unfortunately walmart employees cant even afford an old pickup mad,frisconick
938,July 2005,how short is the pontiac5 gearing it seemed a bit high when i drove it    if you mean gear ratios i think the pontiac5 gearing is pretty short driving on the freeway at 80 mph my usual highway cruise speed in sixth gear you get 25  3 k rpms i can even drive at 40 mph in sixth gear on a relatively flat road without having the engine complain    i kind of wished 6th gear was taller so i could get better gas mileage cruising on the freeway oh well of course this shorter gearing is better for performance because you can use more gears when accelerating also a shorter sixth gear means you dont have to shift down if you want to pass some one on the freeeway so i think this is a better choice after all    but the g is definately not one of those german cars with a super tall sixth gear made for cruising at 100 mph,nyrefugee
939,July 2005,also a shorter sixth gear means you dont have to shift down if you want to pass some one on the freeeway so i think this is a better choice after all    but thats precisely why i buy a manual i want to shift volkswagen and mazda think along those you need passing power in top gear lines too and it makes me crazy mad because then i get lousy mileage on road trips in their cars    give me a really really tall 6th if at 80 i still need more power to pass ill fall back to 4th and take off i still get over 30 mpg running 8590 all day in my bmw but i still wish the cars 6th gear was even taller    i bought a manual to control the card,blueguydotcom
940,July 2005,you have a point it almost seems that the japanese engineers assumed that americans follow speed limits when deciding on the pontiac5 gearing big mistake so if you want max fuel efficiency on the highway you will probably have to drive the speed limit around 65 mph    but as i said above there is a bright side  more shifting fun at lower speeds,nyrefugee
941,July 2005,for some reason better top gear acceleration i suppose infinitis are geared lower than pretty much all the competition look at any rpm at 60 mph figures in the car mags the the pontiac5 and bmw5 are spinning about 500 rpm higher than the competition i think this is what kills the highway mileage compared to say a tl,lmacmil
942,July 2005,for some reason better top gear acceleration i suppose infinitis are geared lower than pretty much all the competition    im sure their engineers decided more oomph when you mash the pedal down would sell more cars than an extra 23 mpg    personally 30mpg highway  20 city will make me move on but i know im not like most americans,dhanley
943,July 2005,the mpg was one of the several reasons i chose the tl over the pontiac5x to have to pay for premium gas and get relatively poor mpg was just too much for my frugal new england psyche to take    a1 service on wednesday ive asked dealer to investigate the intermittent disappearing temperaturememory settings and a rattle when the sunroof is in the vent position thats it so far  13 jaguar xf possibly my favorite of all the cars ive owned but my 09 jag xk was a beauty as was my 05 acura tl 88 acura acura 84 mitsubishi mirage turbo  78 volkswagen scirocco my first and of course the 92 nissan nissan ser and 95 saab 900s i bought for the ex ok i like a lot of the cars in my life,laurasdada
944,July 2005,personally 30mpg highway  20 city will make me move on but i know im not like most americans     then you should probably go for the audi audi 2l turbo its mileage is pretty damn good for a 200hp car i almost got it but in the end could not resist the performance of the pontiac5,nyrefugee
945,July 2005,note i also posted this on the help me choose board but i wanted to post it here because i am looking for a performance sedan also i live in chicago and when it comes to rwd vs awd i dont know which one is better for the gs430 and just fyi i have a longer term goal set on the 07 gs but thats when i have a larger income      greetings im a former owner of a 00 lexus and 02 lexus i absolutely loved the prestige of driving a lexus the color combo of the 00 was graphiteblack and the 02 was goldcream i definitely prefer the black interior and i have quite honestly been spoiled with the luxury convenience features like heated seats passenger control climate moonroof speed controlled volume etc the 02 had a nav system rain sensor wipers and more bells and whistles than i could imagine but the radical change in body style reminded me too much of a toyota and i would prefer s distinct style in my vehicle i actually walked up to a toyota on several occasions thinking it was mine    so now im looking at the 02 or 03 gs430 i like the luxury sport sedan combo the 04 pontiac5 and the 04 or 05 acura tl im hearing great things about the nav system in the tl which is not a need but a definite desire some of the things that i have not experienced but would like to have are  bluetooth capability i didnt have a bluetooth capable phone when i had the 02  steering wheel controls for radiocd  dvdcd player  voice commands for nav  traffic guidance for nav  i hear these last 2 items are features of the tls nav system    oh and my price range is low 30s yes i know i want the world but whats a single female with no children to do these days besides splurge on herself before shes unable to do so im not sure i want to give up driving a lex but i just might have to any thoughts,laydi
946,July 2005, then you should probably go for the audi audi 2l turbo its mileage is pretty damn good for a 200hp car    i would also say that the audi doesnt feel like a 200 hp car at least not to me it feels darn strong    fortunately there are several choices for good mileage and good power audi tl 330 s40t5 93,dhanley
947,July 2005,i never really think of prestige when researching cars i just saw the tl on the street and thought to myself that is one very nice looking car    test drive a tl and gun it on the freeway plus the tl has lots of lux going for it p,frisconick
948,July 2005,greetings im a former owner of a 00 lexus and 02 lexus i absolutely loved the prestige of driving a lexusi actually walked up to a toyota on several occasions thinking it was mine      hmm so much for prestige if youre mistaking your own car for a toyota    so now im looking at the 02 or 03 gs430 i like the luxury sport sedan combo the 04 pontiac5 and the 04 or 05 acura tl im hearing great things about the nav system in the tl which is not a need but a definite desire some of the things that i have not experienced but would like to have are    acura hands down has the best navi system it makes the equivalent items in infinitibmwlexus look like tinker toys    bluetooth capability i didnt have a bluetooth capable phone when i had the 02  steering wheel controls for radiocd    common in acura steering wheel controls are in the g but no bluetooth    dvdcd player    to watch if thats what you mean itll be aftermarket    voice commands for nav  acura    traffic guidance for nav  0506 acura rl is the only one i know of with this feature    oh and my price range is low 30s    acura tl done go find one drive it and if you like it buy it acura acura offers most of the same features for much less  under 30k better car imho too,blueguydotcom
949,July 2005,if she has been driving a lex a acura might be too much of a harsh ride and so would a bmw tl has a smoother ride and and tons of power i wouldnt say a acura is a better car just different however for a sporty ride the acura is a fantastic value its like getting a bmw for 10k less at least,frisconick
950,July 2005,ts like getting a bmw for 10k less at least    the acura is a good car but its nothing like a bmw better tranny better workmanship than a 3 by a long shot but also less powerful rides too high has a 4 cylinder and its got power going to the wrong wheels    if i had to spend 26k on a car the acura is a strong contender if ive got 35k the 330i wins without a fight,blueguydotcom
951,July 2005,better interior more features stronger power luxurious ride incredible stereo equal reliability plenty of room if i was cruising on a crosscountry drive thats the car to drive at the 30k price point if you are a high performance driver there are better choices but the tl is the one my wife would want as you are both steeped in luxury and driving a goodlooking machine i personally like the silver with the black leather interior for this car,jamesspot
952,July 2005,if she has been driving a lex a acura might be too much of a harsh ride and so would a bmw tl has a smoother ride and and tons of power    hm if you mean the 330i with the sport package then maybe it has 18 inch rims otherwise i dont think the 3 is harsher than the tl,dhanley
953,July 2005,my wife chose the silver with black interior p but lets be honest here the car otd is going to be at least 35k for a navi i love my wifes tl she cant get me out of it,frisconick
954,July 2005,she mentioned 04sprivate party on an 04 with navi and 20000 miles is 28k,blueguydotcom
955,July 2005,good point but 20000 miles on a one year old car is a lot it did seem that she was willing to buy used luxsports cars i was just thinking that if she drove a tl i think she would be impressed,frisconick
956,July 2005,an 04 tl is nearly two model years old 06s are two months awayso 2430k miles is normal,blueguydotcom
957,July 2005,ill have to weigh in on the side of the tl  heres some general comments no particular order and i include a little scoring system 1 for 1st 0 for 2nd 1 for 3rd thats really just for my own fun    1 ride quality as far as ride quality id guess you prefer a cushier luxurious ride to a sporty tight ride the used gs430 your considering would probably have the best ride but with all the hightech features you want the tl would probably be a good compromise between comfort price and features the pontiac5 has the most sporty probably least forgiving ride of the 3 gs 1 tl 0 pontiac5 1    2 status i think acura has the least status among lexus infiniti and acura i think lexus is 1 of those 3 so the gs has it here too gs 2 tl 1 pontiac5 1    3 features the used gs isnt going to be the most technologically advanced of the 3 cars you might be considering the tl has it hands down with all the features you mentioned except for traffic navigation only in the rl  maybe the infiniti m and a video player youll also have to say goodbye to rainsensing wipers something i sorely miss from my last car the voicerecognition of the tls nav and its acuration with climate control and the radio is utterly amazing i cannot understate this you can be driving and just verbally tell the car to change the temp pass temp only direct air through particular vents etc you can scroll through your presets and when theres nothing on the radio direct the cd player to play any particular track on any particular disc  its awesome as an aside the infiniti m which is out of your price range and might be too rough a ride has the best technological features of any car i know if it came with a manual transmission itd be my dream car another bonus to the tls nav is that its a touchscreen which makes entering info manually much easier than otherwise and you can enter info while in motion my parents lexus does not allow this i dont know about the pontiac5s nav but in general i think the pontiac5 is the least technically advanced of the 3 but a new g would have it over an onlder lexus i think gs 1 tl 0 pontiac5 1    price im not checking the classifieds for you but i know that to get all the tech features you want itll add much more to the gs since itll probably need to be aftermarket if it can be done at all and itll cost the least extra on the tl bc its all included except the nav which is pretty common depending on the changes made on the 06 models you might be willing to save even more  by buying a used tl or pontiac5 gs 0 tl 1 pontiac5 1    anyway my scoring has the tl ontop no surprise  its what i drive but disregarding the scoring for a sec you need to discount the bmw  pontiac5 bc they value sportiness over luxury and you seem to prefer luxury the gs has it in luxurious ride and prestige the tl has it in technology i think your choice comes down to those two and will depend on which you value more    ps  i think a guy will be more impressed by a tl than a gs as a single gal that might play into things a bit,ljwalters1
958,July 2005,the past two season bill auberlin won the touring car national championship in a bmw 325 this year hes down in cumulative points because hes only raced a few events since he is also racing in other type events he won the last touring car race at lime rock park a few weeks ago  comparing these highly tuned machines is not an indicator of which is faster each car has weight added or taken out based on how well they did in the previous race if you win two races in a row you get weight added each time they intentionally try to level the field to make it competitive for the fans  front wheel drive or rear wheel drive is a personal preferance but more people who like to drive spiritedly choose rear wheel drive and a manual transmission the current issue of automobile magazine compares what they call the best sports sedans from three continents they selected the cadillac ctv from the us the bmw 330i from europe and the infiniti pontiac5 from asia they made a point about leaving out a very good acura tl because it was not rear wheel drive and therefore not a true sports sedan ive owned alot of cars over the years including a number of front wheel drive models nothing could touch my two miatas for handling the miata has 6 consecutive national championships in autocross i currently drive a 2005 infiniti pontiac5 6 speed and a 2002 bmw z3 30i 5 speed roadster rear wheel drive has a different feel to it you either like it or you dont,perunest
959,July 2005,excuse my ignorence but is the miata a fwd or rwd,frisconick
960,July 2005,hmm its only been out for over 15 years rwd,blueguydotcom
961,July 2005,the tls flying wedge design seems more audi mixed with alfa than the sexiness of the original acura legend that car still draws my eyes every time i see one much like the second gen acura and acura still make me look cant explain it but the tl almost seems like some wacky european film set designer for a cheap scifi film said i vill make future car and out popped the tl with its hard angles square taillights and rectangluar exhaust ports long low wide and most spaceshippy in that dark gray color i see it and think of dr evil saying with pride what do you think of your quasifuturistic car mr powers    lol very funny post p    i thought the design of the car was fantastic and a nice departure from japanese conservative design it has a definite alfa influence as well as some bmw features i usually dont car about the exterior look of a car but this car knocked me out then i checked out what this car has to offer in performance and lux features i found it to be the best value out there regardless of price,frisconick
962,July 2005,english lesson  the word pantheon has at least 5 definations look them up while you may have walked pass a pantheon in paris the pantheon is in rome,jimr21713
963,July 2005,perhaps the 3 series has outgrown me what was once a willing accomplice for backroad rowdiness seems all grown up it no longer whispers lets go out and risk a moving violation it is now a perfectly pleasant responsible companion    if value is the criteria it may not match the infiniti pontiac5 or the lexus is 350 which goes on sale in october and while no one can accuse the new 3 series of not being fun to drive it may no longer hold the clear edge that it once did    sounds like nyt isnt all that wild on 3 the battle between it and is and nextgen g probably will be very close too close for bmw comfort    httpwwwnytimescom20050724automobiles24autohtml8dpc,mariner7
964,July 2005,however its amazing that bmw is still able to hold the small luxurysport sedan crown the fact that the competition has caught up is mostly because they are trying to implement a lot of the same ideas look at the last lexus i dont think that the i6 was a mistake look at the pontiac5 infiniti took almost an american approach viz more horsepower theyve been trying for years and years if they didnt start putting the heat on then id be worried its not that the 3series isnt the best drive or that it isnt the most fun its just that bmw got a little out of hand with the pricing bring it down a few ks and theyll be raving again    hmm time for my styling critique    3series the older ones look aggressive kind of like theyll jump out and take a hunk out of a passerbys leg the curvier shape of the new one looks a little blobby still a hell of a drive though    pontiac5 suffers from what i call lack of style namely that it doesnt have a lot going on especially from the side view where it looks rather like a loaf of bread thats the coupe the sedan looks classier especially in black but still not a heartstopper    cts no comment p    is talking about the new one it looks classy but kind of boring not in a bad way but it looks like a lexus better than the pontiac5 or cts but i honestly think that the tl looks better or rather its a mood thing the tl is the wacky little sister who listens to new age and the is is the adult sis who listens to soft rock    tl a little crazy but it works i like the fact that honda took a styling chance when they didnt have to kudos i like the way it looks weird this car however does not look as good in black as most of the others probably since a nice silver would hyundaiuate its creases better    audi the front end looks good  i like the new grille the back doesnt too boring,chris65amg
965,July 2005, the original post was about the parthenon not the pantheon    and the original parthenon is in athens greece you know the rundown one    if you want to see a restored version travel to nashville tn they have a very nice replica    okay now back to your mindless bickering about style  moderator    prices paid lease questions suvs,kyfdx
966,July 2005,i agree with almost every thing you said but disagree with your opinion about the pontiac5 coupe i think its a knock out in terms of style i dont think its style is as bold as the tl yes the g sedan is a classy looking car but sort of too conservative for my taste interestingly i think the g coupe looks great in black but i think the tl looks great in any color but i prefer the lighter colors    the tl is the wacky little sister who listens to new age    lol,frisconick
967,July 2005,from the front of a tl you can see a definate alfa influence and from the side a bmw influence,frisconick
968,July 2005,im sorry take some reading comprehension courses    httpwwwaviewoncitiescomparispantheonhtm    quote on top of the montagne stegeneviève not far from the sorbonne university and the jardin du luxembourg the imposing panthéon looks over the quartier latin    that is the name of the building the word is capitalized and everything  just as i used it    yes its modeled after the roman building the portico with large corinthian columns was modeled after the 2nd buick pantheon in rome  regardless i used the correct name and wrote it correctly no big deal just dont get up in my face if you dont take the time to do any research    there are several disney properties around the world the decrepit one in anaheim may have been the first but if some cat says he went to disneyland in japan are you gonna flag him for it screaming no no its originally in california man lighten up have a pop tart,blueguydotcom
969,July 2005,is the pantheon as fast as the bmw bmw p,frisconick
970,July 2005,i think the best sportscar you can get with 50k is a chevrolet beautiful fast in every aspect of the word and a relatively good daily ride too,taxesquire
971,July 2005,i love the tls styling i look at it from the front and the headlightsetup reminds me of ford ford from the side its bmw bmwish and from the back  well i dont know what it is from the back but it looks nice and i think the trapezoidal  exhaust pipes are cool shades    bytheway delmar sorry i didnt have your back during the tl slam event mad i left work early and have been doin the husbanddaddy thing til now anyway ive decided to stop replying to the tls are honda comments yes its based on an honda but its better in so many ways that the educated consumer wouldnt think of them the same im bored with the whole argument    and bytheway the comments of whether the tl was girlie was disgusting and you should be ashamed beautiful is beautiful  and there are fast women drivers just like there are fast men drivers i drive much faster than my wife but she taught me to drive a manual tranny what does that tell you about her or i nothing the tls a beautiful car for any driver i think it looks kinda tough and my mom shied away from it for that reason but i wouldnt love my tl any less if my mom had one its one of the few cars that truly balances luxury and performance shed get it for the luxury features including the logical voicerecognition thatd make her carrides more enjoyable i got it for that too but more for its power and handling    anyone categorizing a vehicle as girlie or otherwise needs to grow up and define themselves by more things than what they drive or the size of theircar,taxesquire
972,July 2005,i would be concerned about the vettes reliability but the vette has a lot of wow they have a convertable with 500 horses p,frisconick
973,July 2005,cant agree more    taxesquire  they made up a girlie category or they have to rely on feelings because they cant bash the car in reality real world they cant deny all the factsnumbers    blueguy  changed you mind about tl ended up in a ditch    all cars can get smoked while getting inout of a corner but tl will smoke them again in 57 secs hey at least i have a fact not just feeling 57    bmw rwdundepower understeer speaking about getting smoked    pontiac5 rwdoversteer tail out  you get smoked too    tl fwdlargely devoid any torque steer remedy dont leave you hands off the steering wheel while cornering   well i get smoked too,danny1878
974,July 2005,the vette is a very tempting car especially because i am not that old yet and i would look good in it,frisconick
975,July 2005,my dad had the last model vette and absolutely loved it he also had no mechanical problems and he drives cars harder than anyone i know btw dont know if they still have the manual convertable top but if they do it shouldnt scare you  very easy to do  even faster than the electric ones    i think its also gotten very good writeups as being a very liveable sportscar    that the restyled vettes got rid of the popup lights is a huge plus to me its a beaut,taxesquire
976,July 2005,although your dad had no problems that is only a sample of one and not something i would take seriously i have to do more research on the car before i can make a decision i was not considering the car unitl i saw your posts now i am going to research the car big time    its a beaut no kidding p,frisconick
977,July 2005,okyou are partially correct regarding the pantheon as i have visited both locationsand not a figment of your imagination    howeverthe location in paris took on the literal definition of pantheon and named after the roman temple pantheon is defined as a temple dedicated to all gods or a public building commemorating and dedicated to the heroes and herioines on a nation    generally when people refer to pantheonthey refer to the ancient temple located in rome see the below link    httpwwwgreatbuildingscombuildingspantheonhtml    yesthe paris building was built after the rome temple if you look at your links fourth paragraph it indicates the portico with large corinthian columns was modeled after the 2nd buick pantheon in rome    sorry for the history lesson everyone,delmar1
978,July 2005,yes but two seats low in the utility value unless of course the back seats arent needed and then you have to deal with the less than hyundai interior compared to some other sports cars,kdshapiro
979,July 2005,the original post indicated the two criteria of 50k and toyota if you remove the requirement of toyotathere are plenty of choices bmw i would go with the 5 series myself,delmar1
980,July 2005,sorry blueguydotcomi didnt mean to impose and get up in your face and even posted further until i saw your latest response    hey folksi have been posting on this forum since late this past week some of you thought i was bashing and all just to clear the airnoi was not flaming or bashing the pontiac5 all my comments were straight up and honest and as factual as i am aware just some people dont want to hear the truth or can appreciate an alternate point of view thereforei even gave up on the topic of discussion as it is falling on deaf ears alrightyi vented    any howif you folks havent been to paristhe latin quartier is great  and take the subwaysone of the best around the world,delmar1

982,July 2005,del    no problem    i dig europe i was just talking to a friend last night about parisfrance and italy shes trying to convince me to fly back there soon but we originally made plans for march when i pick up my e90 for euro delivery of course im now reconsidering the e90 because of bmw inability to fix my e46 thus maybe ill get a used pontiac5 new miata or a new acura to hold me over for a few years until the bmw sedan shows up,blueguydotcom
983,July 2005,goodglad you understand    one last travel tip for the folks hereespecially those that like to travel you have to consider visiting china the foreign currency conversion is incredible why pay the 30 premium for euros when you can still get 15 discount to the usd incredible to see not only the historic and ancient china ie terracotta warriors of xianbut to see the incredible industrialization i never seen so many cranes in action in any city all the major cities and with thatyou all can understand how the price of gas is going up with their consumption    cars therethe worst  freeway traffic in shanghainever seen anything like it and they tax the heck out of you for licenses from what i understand    back to the tl talk let me ask againthe tl interior since the ford has been on the exterior i still say it is one of the best in the category thoughts,delmar1
984,July 2005,love audivolkswagen interiors then bmw then mb then tl finally pontiac5lexus    i like interiors that are cold remote and not the least bit cushy im odd like that,blueguydotcom
985,July 2005,most silver tls have a black interior with a brushed aluminum finish very cool and not at alll cushy you would love it,frisconick
986,July 2005,and then you have to deal with the less than hyundai interior compared to some other sports cars    as with all cars in this discussion theres a balance between sportiness and comfort i dont believe there is any vehicle faster than the chevrolet in terms of straightout accelleration and handling that also has a better interior design,taxesquire
987,July 2005,guess my suggestions for a sporty toyota would be a lexis sc and probably the upcoming is    has the celica been redesigned recently i know the eclipse has and it looks very cool,taxesquire

990,July 2005,actually there are plenty faster than the vette but not at that price point there are also some cars faster than the vette that are much less expensive as in the evo but since you qualified it with disclaimer regarding the interior ill just say the vette is a niche vehicle with two seats,kdshapiro

1008,August 2005,good god another newbie driver    im sorry did you check his profile or something did he check the newbie driver box otherwise quit with the insults    fyi i have clocked over 150k miles on manual cars    and ive clocked over 312k miles 500k km on manual cars and never once had a transmission failure nor have i had to ever replace a clutch despite having 112k miles on one car    are you sure you can shift as fast as smg    strawman argument no one here has made that claim but you keep arguing against it    skipping gear and thoughts have absolutely nothing to do with 060    and going 060 has absolutely nothing to do with his original post again no one here is claiming that manuals are inherently faster 060 than automatics but if your interest lies in keeping the rpms at a steady boil when braking into a turn youd be better off picking your own gears and finessing the clutch than fighting with the transmission as it tries to upshift when you let off the gas    the shifting points are precaculated for that drag run and it will be an exercise in reflex    taking the joy out of driving is not my idea of progress,potemkin
1009,August 2005,thank you for your support and well put in the bargain    newbie well ive driven 11 million miles and most of it was in vehicles with manual transmissions the 95000 that wasnt is why i feel so strongly about never having another automatic mg two miatas 240z kenworth truck  one of the very few lincoln lss produced with a getrag manual extinct now as it turns out    those who prefer to do their driving in a straight line with max acceleration the only criterion clearly have a different point of view,cdnpinhead
1010,August 2005,well i know that list is not completely accurate because the auto version of the volvor comes nowhere close to even 6 seconds let alone 54 thats the 6speed version the auto is much closer to 7 secs due to the decreased torque in the first 2 gears  17 ford crew 27 67 coronet rt 14 towncountry limited 09 lsubaru hse 44car history and counting,qbrozen
1011,August 2005,the question remains what in the world does the advantage of manual at keeping the engine at boil have anything to do with 060 numbers    taking the joy out of driving is not my idea of progress    whats the joy in 060 drag racing if there is none to begin with how can any be taken out bluedotcomguy and were discussing 060 under 7 being a requirement for any car being considered remotely sporty if your argument is that straitline performance is not as relevent as handling you are actually in my corner,brightness04
1012,August 2005,those who prefer to do their driving in a straight line with max acceleration the only criterion clearly have a different point of view    then you are siding me with in my discussion with blue i was pointing out that there are many decently sporty cars with slower than 7 060 the tranny part only came about because imho the auto tranny rating is closer to what most drivers will actually get for 060 even when shifting manual on their own because they can not shift as fast as smg or professional drivers that makes a whole slew of cars slower than 7 in the hands of their owners all those 6569 cars whether manual is superior to automatic in driving experience was never part of the discussion,brightness04
1013,August 2005,how about 060 merging onto an chevroletway from a red light straighline performance in this instance is very relavant how about increased gas mileage there is a reason autos typically are slower than manuals and get worse gas mileage can you say torque converter    xsgs are the perfect medium    for those who are interested in maximum control of the cars manual or smgs are the way to go,kdshapiro
1014,August 2005,discussing 060 under 7 being a requirement for any car being considered remotely sporty    i thought he said in my eyes if a car costs over 30k it better do 60 in less than 7 seconds agree with him or not thats a pretty clear statement of his opinion  and one that didnt mention anything about a requirement for sportiness,fedlawman
1015,August 2005,its not about what the driver can do its about what the car can do so im not sure of your point autos vs trannies are an individual preference the amount of fine tuning a driver has over a car is best with a manual but the driver does more work but in the end the driver can only do what the car is capable of doing,kdshapiro
1016,August 2005,i think you misunderstood what blueguy was saying    he has stated in other posts that he holds cars like the miata and acura in high regard both are sporty cars that post 060 numbers above 7 seconds but they also cost less than 30000    30000 is simply a line he has personally drawn in the sand in a day when cars are as powerful and quick as they are today its not unreasonable to desire a 30000 vehicle that achieves certain benchmarks    would you not be a little embarassed when you stomp the go pedal at a fresh green light in your brand new 33000 slush box 325i and the honda honda next to you with 2 kids watching shrek 2 in the back pulls ahead and changes lanes in front of you,fedlawman
1017,August 2005,whats the joy in 060 drag racing if there is none to begin with how can any be taken out bluedotcomguy and were discussing 060 under 7 being a requirement for any car being considered remotely sporty    uhuh i never mentioned sporty i simply called slower to 60 cars that cost over 30k dogs    if your argument is that straitline performance is not as relevent as handling you are actually in my corner    i want both yeah a gen 1 miata in the twisties was a hoot but you and i both know that same car with 200 more hp would have been absolutely exhilirating hit a tight 270 degree 15 mph corner and with a manual and a decent engine im going to be a happy camper    cost to fun ratio i can snatch up a new miata loaded for 2425k thatll put a grin a on my face because it doesnt cross that imaginary line of 30k,blueguydotcom
1018,August 2005,now that most autos in this category are 5 and 6 speed automatics it wouldnt surprise me if pedaltothemetal on a straightaway they were faster than their manual cousins due to human limitations though tests dont seem to show that as being the case i feel confident that a 5 speed automatic would be clearly faster than a manual of the same car driven by myself blush but taking out the human error is what makes the car less sporty    its not so much whether you can lay out the dough to buy a fast car  its whether you personally can make any particular car operate at its best regardless of whether that means keeping rpms down to stretch every last ounce of gas or running right up to the redline id think id get more satisfaction out of maximizing the hp in a manual 4 cylinder honda honda than just slamming my foot down on an automatic porsche boxter    think about nascar  the argument that its not a sport is based on the fact that it mainly involves machines and the best machine will win pronascar arguments revolve around the human interaction  when to slow down when to accelerate when to block an opposing car the pit crew etc automatics take a level of involvement out of the equation and lessen the sport of the whole thing,taxesquire
1019,August 2005,not sure why you are addressing that to me are you saying a person merging onto an chevroletway from a red light will be able to shift faster than heshe otherwose would be able to do i dont get it the discussion was never about manual vs automatic but whether the published automatic rating or mnual rating for 060 is more relevent to what most owners actually get almost no one can shift a manual as fast as smg dah thats why they invented smg in racing few can shift manual faster than a modern automatic for that matter therefore what people actually get from their car are closer to the cars automatic 060 rating not the manual rating when driven by professional drivers    whether manual or automatic is better for personal taste is entirely a different story altogether depending on your driving condition etc,brightness04
1020,August 2005,would you not be a little embarassed when you stomp the go pedal at a fresh green light in your brand new 33000 slush box 325i and the honda honda next to you with 2 kids watching shrek 2 in the back pulls ahead and changes lanes in front of you    thats been the fact of life for many 325i owners for years substitute v6 honda for the honda and you still get that today with the new model,brightness04
1021,August 2005,while i never had any objections to the prior versions of the bmw 3 5 or 7 i found them to be clean handsome and functional designs    i agree exactly with that assessment but i also love the new looks they are very striking and have a great presence the bmw especially is a head turner the new bmw convertible me wants    the new designs have taken some bad press but in the real world where people actually vote with their wallets the designs actually seemed to be like it amazes me when i talk to people there are some who didnt like the old but love the new    in the end though we all agree that styling is subjective,kdshapiro

1026,August 2005,once again to remind everyone that we are specifically discussing the 6 vehicles listed at the top of this page i realize the name of the discussion invites the inclusion of vehicles not listed but the reality is that we are restricted to those six because of the interlinking of this discussion with articles on the main site related to only those six vehicles    we have been through this many times before so let me try to head off what has happened in the past  this reality cannot be changed at this time    and we will not go where weve gone before which is getting mired in how thats not right and what vehicles should be added because none of this can be changed     so i would really appreciate everyones cooperation in keeping this connissantion primarily forded on the bmw 3 series infiniti pontiac5 acura tl lexus is 300 mercedes benzmercedes benz cclass and cadillac cts    as always anyone who want to compare other vehicles is welcome to look at the main sedans comparisons list for a suitable topic  if one doesnt exist feel free to fire up a new one    thanks,pat

1028,August 2005,another theory is that with the bmw the looks play second fiddle to other factors such as the overall driving balance of the car or the prestige of the blue and white propellor maybe a potential buyer has to close his eyes when approaching the car   but once behind the wheel it becomes stunningly beautiful and worthy of a few of the buyers hard earned     remember you do drive the car from the inside p how it looks on the outside isnt relative to how it feels on the road    well unless im the typical customer of an idiot salesmen who told me on a test drive to look at your reflection in the buildings as we pass them see how cool you look gotta wonder if people actually fall for that,blueguydotcom
1029,August 2005,iagree the prestige of bmw for a lot of people definitely worth the extra money besides just think what those chicks think if you tell them you drive a bimmer remember the saying you get what you pay for    zero prestige its a bmw dude not a ferrarilambo    the only girls impressed by a bmw are bumpkins and golddiggers    confuse prestigerofl,blueguydotcom

1037,August 2005,many years ago through a shopping mall parking lot in scottsdale in his fully trickedout chevrolet ive lost what respect i used to have for some women    if i hadnt been there i wouldnt have believed it but i was driving a hot car appears to work in ways that i never knew about then or care about now come to it its an anthropoligy thing    i enjoy driving at high speed in very rural areas no people around just like i like it,cdnpinhead

1041,August 2005,yeah to bad it doesnt handle as good and goobles gas seems to me the pontiac5 is trying to aspire to be a bmw,kdshapiro
1042,August 2005,the pontiac5 coupe does handle as good as the bmw but does gobble gas with a 298hp engine that wipes out most bmw except the mucho expensive m what do you expect if you want to save on gas buy a toyota p,frisconick
1043,August 2005,actually it doesnt wipe out anything hp is not the be all and end all my guess the 3 manual would beat it on the laps just like in the rt comparo it may get to the red light 0001 seconds faster than a bmw but thats about it    now if you want to say the 3 is more expensive ill agree but the two cars have different missions in life you may be one of the rare few people that actually enjoys paying 3gallon,kdshapiro
1044,August 2005,hp does mean a lot 060 14 mile etc the g wipes out the the bmw 3 i dont mind paying 3 a gallon in california its only a few hundred a year big deal are you so poor you cant afford that if so buy a honda or toyota p buy the way those are two great cars,frisconick

1046,August 2005,saigon    only you can tell if the zpp v zsp v zhp makes the difference for you i found the standard and zpp cars to be a little puffy the sport package 330i was fun zhp more fun in the end even the zhp is too soft for my style of driving    what was wrong with waiting 10 weeks youve waited your whole lifewhats 70 measely days,blueguydotcom
1047,August 2005,okay show me a comparo where the g wipes out the 3 i can show you one where the 3 wipes the g    i just ran across thisjust for a break in the connissantion    httpwwwcaranddrivercomarticleaspsectionid29articleid9902,kdshapiro
1048,August 2005,unless you are a host i am not apoligizing for anything i am not saying that the pontiac5 is dominant just a better value than the bmw i think thats what is really bothering you additionally if you can afford a 35k car poor mileage isnt going to force you into the poor house buying a pontiac5 298hp coupe is not a sensible buy you are buying a great sporty car that gobbles gas you go in knowing that,frisconick
1049,August 2005,i am not saying that the pontiac5 is dominant just a better value than the bmw    i agree its more expensive but everybodys definition of value is different and thats what this connissantion is about yes gas price shouldnt matter but the fact is with a smaller engine and less hp and power the 3 series holds its own against the g most magazines consider the new 3 the new benchmark    however having said that there are real reasons for looking at other manufacturers bmw has always been the drivers benchmark which is one reason i am interested in them i dont care for the other stuff such as dvda nav etc give me a well tuned creamy smooth vehicle that almost drives me and i am happy    i wouldnt throw the g tl or any other car out of my garage if one landed inside i just wouldnt pay for them,kdshapiro
1050,August 2005,great post    please dont get me wrong i love bmw and i am considering the bmw and the bmw but i just cant justify the cost over the pontiac5 coupe even though i can afford it for the same reason i an considering mb but i cant get over crs low reliability ratings for the mb by the way cr does recommend the bmw 3 series,frisconick
1051,August 2005,there must be a lot of denial going on around here confuse,kdshapiro
1052,August 2005,you gotta ask yourself how did a slower car that broke down beat out a brand new contender that sprang from the most powerful and financially flush company in the world    a vast automotive conspiracy bias    bgdc on the face of it that an unreliable bmw beat out a new lexus smark of conspiracy dont ya think  lets see of the 3 major cateogries  vehicle powertrain and chassis the lexus beat out the 330i in 2 of 3 vehicle and powertrain but lost in the chassis category hmmm  the lexus is a better car where it matters vehicle fitandfinish ergonomics style etc and powertrain performance engine flexibility tranny etc gottahaveitfactor dead tie funtodrive 23to22 a virtual tie so how exactly did this broken down unreliable e90 win  and if you diehard fanatics cannot even see that these two cars are a virtual tie you must have more denial than i think    but more to your point we all know how much these auto rags rave about the 3series as the benchmark of bmw automotive engineering excellence to beat that car will take a herculian task and the lexus did even with a slushbox  the measured objective and subjective difference bw the e90 and the lexus is infinitesimal at best virtual tie at worst that it took lexus 6 years to beat the vaunted 3series is what counts not the unreliability of the bimmer or the money flush at toylexus at least they put their money where their mouth is,oac
1053,August 2005,dont look now but the total package is missing a manual transmission assuming youre referring to the lexus as you yourself chevroleted just imagine the is with a infiniti imagine id rather they actually make one available but thats just me    for how many people in the na market  even bmw sells far more slushboxes than stick shifts so     the lexus i drove had more hp  tq than the 325i e46 i bought why did i buy the 3 because hp isnt everything and thats a fact    then what is  oh i forget the name and the hype  the ultimate driving machine always trumps reality    i like the new is more than most but without a clutch and h pattern shifter available the 350 isnt even a consideration if i were looking at purchasing a new car this fall id be looking seriously at the lexus not the lexus    and youll be missing out on the overall best car for ya money in the category your loss is someone elses gain there wont be enough lexuss for the demand you can bet that    by the way a v6 is a step backwards over the previous i6    the same ol song from bmw officianados the v6 in the is is smoother more efficient provides better mpg than an i6 can ever be and it is technologically superior to an i6 there ,oac
1054,August 2005,and youll be missing out on the overall best car for ya money in the category your loss is someone elses gain there wont be enough lexuss for the demand you can bet that    well i can understand your feelings of frustration having an automaker with 11b in cash not being able to beat bmw at their own game    this thread is the redux of the highend luxury marquees wheres merc1 when we need him    in addition with katrina and current bump in fuel prices this might not be the best time to introduce a thirsty car hubris about the gas mileage aside if people drive these cars as intended they will probably be getting less than hyundai gas mileage my guess is oil will top 80barrel shortly ouch could rain on lexus parade,kdshapiro
1055,August 2005,well i can understand your feelings of frustration having an automaker with 11b in cash not being able to beat bmw at their own game    frustration what frustration  ttc all im doing is pointing out reality from hypeu all gotta remove the blinders and face the truth your vaunted bmw aint all that no more  there is a new kid on the block now and it is the lexus    this thread is the redux of the highend luxury marquees wheres merc1 when we need him    you need merc1 to defend ya     my guess is oil will top 80barrel shortly ouch could rain on lexus parade    really  with lexus bringing out more fuelefficient cars in the next couple of years how can that hurt them  the toyota is a best seller the toyotah rx400h are all selling quite well the lexush will be here in 6 months and soon the toyotah what does bmw have to offer the buyers in fuelefficient cars  diesel  ya right ,oac
1056,August 2005,the redux of the high end luxury marques discussion it is a discussion specifically about the vehicles listed above it is not a general connissantion about the manufacturers and it is not about each other    please keep your comments confined to the subject vehicles thanks,pat
1057,August 2005,what the hell id rather a disel to a gaselectric hybrid no contest diesels run forever and get outstanding gas mileage on the freeway while still supplying great torque batteries engine shutdown i know from experience with turbo diesels that i can pound them and still get great mileage from what ive heard even nanny drivers that do 7080 on the freeway dont come close to 50 mpg with a toyota the performance hybrids weigh more and get basically a little bit better mileage than gas versions    oh and oac youre basically saying theres a vast automotive conspiracy directing the 330i to beat the lexus in subjective tests,blueguydotcom
1058,August 2005,when buying my g a couple of years ago i remember the dealership plastered with an article titled the bmw beater when you told them you were also considering other options namely the 3 series they threw the book at you literally well the magazine reprint anyway i bought the g but even though the magazine touted the g as being a bmw beater they confessed that the only reason the bmw lost was because it was priced higher than a comparably equipped g the g has been selling for some time now and guess what bmw has survived no wait thrived i equate the upcoming lexus with the introduction of the g im not one who pulls out a magazine and points to numbers when justifying my decision but kdshapiro makes a good point toyota with all of their resources were despite their best effort and a truck load of hp unable to bump bmw off its seat at the top and some of you are not giving those of us in our early 20s enough credit i choose the 3 over all the other models because i like a car that can hold its own as a complete package hp is not the deciding factor for me and im sure its not the only consideration for many future bmw buyers    but before everyone erupts in an argument over which sedan is superior let the gosh darn thing arrive on us soil for sale before throwing punches i bet bmw comes out on top in the end its quite a feat to unseat the old master especially when he re invents himself with the help of one of the best automobile companies around,bmwe90
1059,August 2005,i agree just wait until the car gets here first instead of second guessing whos better this discussion could go on forever peoples opinions will differ and tahts it hard to change someones mind once its set on something just wait til the is gets here then well continue our convo ,saigonboi21
1060,August 2005,its about the cars listed at the top    and yeah theres an toyota in here and it aint of the toyota variety,pat
1061,August 2005,ah but entry level sport sedans in this world market with diesels are plentiful were not really talking out of turn as bmw mb and the is are all available with diesel engines,blueguydotcom

1063,August 2005,sorry pat    im picking up my new tl tomorrow i ruled out rwd cars because i dont want to put on snow tires every year and id need to here in upstate ny i chose the tl over the pontiac5 awd and lexus awd because of overall value better mileage than the g and more power than the is    thanks to everyone here for helping with my decision    tim,albanytim
1064,August 2005,congrats tim if you have the nonnav tl with bridgestone turanza el42 tires be very careful in the snow my first winter with mine here in boston left me wholly unimpressed with the snow performace of these tires take it slow    other than the tires cool car does everything well imho best looking of the bunch too  13 jaguar xf possibly my favorite of all the cars ive owned but my 09 jag xk was a beauty as was my 05 acura tl 88 acura acura 84 mitsubishi mirage turbo  78 volkswagen scirocco my first and of course the 92 nissan nissan ser and 95 saab 900s i bought for the ex ok i like a lot of the cars in my life,laurasdada
1065,August 2005,regarding the comparos everyone who is simply declaring a victor by the numbers dont forget that the judges all drove the cars and made their decisions does a 060 of 56 vs 58 or 84 vs 87 gs on the skidpad really matter in the real world to you read all you want but drive the cars and make your decisions and voice opinions dont just regurgitate s from the autorags and cr btw long time c and d subscriber love the mag and respect most of their opinions is the is better than the 3 is the g better than the tl is the tl better than all of em yes to each if youve done the research driven the cars and evaluated them versus your criteria thats how i ended up with the tl    but keep discussing im sure you will convert everyone to your way of thinking sooner or later  13 jaguar xf possibly my favorite of all the cars ive owned but my 09 jag xk was a beauty as was my 05 acura tl 88 acura acura 84 mitsubishi mirage turbo  78 volkswagen scirocco my first and of course the 92 nissan nissan ser and 95 saab 900s i bought for the ex ok i like a lot of the cars in my life,laurasdada
1066,August 2005,yet many car manufacturers brag about hp dont they  weve heard for the umpteenth time how many people claim the lexus awd is underpowered because of its 204hp rating relative to the weight of the car maybe bmw erred in upping the hp going from the e46 to the e90 eh  big mistake who needs more hp in these bmw since it appears many of you dont really care for higher hp in your bmw oh i get it since the e90 has lower hp ratings than the top dogs in the class tl g is then hp doesnt count right on bro,oac
1067,August 2005,many car manufacturers do indeed brag about hp and safety and mpg and interior space and value and build quality and reliability and whatever they believe will move iron    drivecompare the cars  13 jaguar xf possibly my favorite of all the cars ive owned but my 09 jag xk was a beauty as was my 05 acura tl 88 acura acura 84 mitsubishi mirage turbo  78 volkswagen scirocco my first and of course the 92 nissan nissan ser and 95 saab 900s i bought for the ex ok i like a lot of the cars in my life,laurasdada
1068,August 2005,drivecompare the cars    i have driven all these cars except the new is which i plan to as soon as it hits the dealer showrooms loved the feel of the bmw i drove very recently would buy the car except for the quirks reliability issues mainly the lexus promises to be a great carso i am looking forward to deciding if it is the car for me well see,oac
1069,August 2005,it doesnt count for some it does count for others lexus was never about hp and now it is since it temporarily has the most hp it should automatically be rated 1 confuse as far as bmw goes they dont have to build the most hp to get the most performance and the best handling bmw was never about hp a lot of cars have much more but dont do quite as much,kdshapiro
1070,August 2005,imho the e46 325i was worthless not nearly enough power for 3035k car same holds true for an lexus    if only want 200 hp ill go buy an audivolkswagen and get a smoother more efficient torquier and in my view better engine than the 30 in my e46,blueguydotcom
1071,August 2005,loved the feel of the bmw i drove very recently would buy the car except for the quirks reliability issues mainly    what quirks and reliability issues surfaced in your test drive,lovemyclk
1072,August 2005,none in a test drive i drove my friends 2001 bmw but it is not comforting to see that a brand spanking new e90 330i tester provided by bmw to cd broke down with several mechanical failures during the cd review what guarantees are there  see what i mean ,oac
1073,August 2005, and i imagine that since the miata mx5 has less than 200hp it would not qualify as a driving machine less hp than the competitors but one of the finest examples of a balanced machine where all the parts work in symphonic harmony true with the bmw as well imo    many posters here appear to know the price of these cars but the value of few the engineering inside of true driving machines allows balance to shine as a primary quality in addition to cornering gs and hp the thought that a 200hp 20 turbo fourbanger in the audivolkswagen even compares with the acclaimed 225hp 30l six in the bmw is an interesting take smoother more efficient better lmao    most advanced engines produced today are admirable but i dont see the audivolkswagen on the wards list as i do the 30 from bmw btw many of the arguments made in this forum for this car or that car would consider ranking a chevrolet ahead of anything simply due to pricehp ratios    kinda like comparing the chevrolet to the 911 both excellent sports cars but are built to different standards than just hp sit in em and driveem more than empirical numbers will shine through and youll feel the difference true in many products from watches to suits    there are buyers for all of these cars that have differing reasons for their choices some financial some just want the fastest for the least and some want the finest that todays automotive engineers can produce regardless of the price  and none are necessarily wrong some buyers just like having the choice of a rolex submariner or a seiko dive watch  its what makes choice a wonderful thing,lovemyclk
1074,August 2005,will have to read the article and get back to you,lovemyclk
1075,August 2005, and i imagine that since the miata mx5 has less than 200hp it would not qualify as a driving machine less hp than the competitors but one of the finest examples of a balanced machine where all the parts work in symphonic harmony true with the bmw as well imo    no that car is under 30k under 30k and under 2600 lbs means that little 160 hp engine is aokay with me ive made myself clear on this over and overover 30k the car better have more than 200 hp    many posters here appear to know the price of these cars but the value of few the engineering inside of true driving machines allows balance to shine as a primary quality in addition to cornering gs and hp the thought that a 200hp 20 turbo fourbanger in the audivolkswagen even compares with the acclaimed 225hp 30l six in the bmw is an interesting take smoother more efficient better lmao    i find the 20 to be far smoother than my 235hp 330i performance package i find the power delivery to be smooth and linear  unlike the hiccuping stuttering peaky style employed on the 30 the 20 is extremely efficient as it gets 2532 v 2030 on my 30 sorry ive owned a 18t and now own a 30 im more impressed by the old 18t and the current 20    as for trannies the dsgs got it all over bmw notchy balky slow binding 6 speeds    most advanced engines produced today are admirable but i dont see the audivolkswagen on the wards list as i do the 30 from bmw    wards list  pr crap its as worthless as a magazine comparo they put the vq on there too and ever since nissan bumped displacement from 30 to 35 that engines been a nvh nightmare at least in my experience with that rough ratchety engine,blueguydotcom
1076,August 2005,btw many of the arguments made in this forum for this car or that car would consider ranking a chevrolet ahead of anything simply due to pricehp ratios    this is so patently false its not even funny maybe you forgot this forum has a list of cars that are in the same class not some far out of space thingy please make better argument and leave out the spurious onescomparing the speeds of an is to a bmw is quite correct afterall they are in the same class,oac
1077,August 2005,thanks got the nav in part for the michelin tires that i read about on these forums hopefully theyll be ok in the snow,albanytim
1078,August 2005,once again you missed the point if you like to go with hp get yourself a dodge and save some money but if you enjoy driving experiance you cant get it in is you also missed some important numbers like slalom and lane change handling makes bmw an ultimate driving machine nice leather makes a lexus you know a lexus you can have a good argument with mb owners but bmw is in the different world i bet fwd tl handles better then is p    boat is a boat even if its small and rwd with lexus badge on it,pg48477
1079,August 2005,could not resist not making a comment here dima you are right here – boat is a boat very comfortable boat i must say and for those who like comfort – that is the perfect choice i tried it i liked it comfort side of it but i am still part of those who prefer superior handling of bmw over any comfort of cars like lexus,odessit
1080,August 2005,its a very nice boat you right for that reason its better comparable with c320 lexus always targeted mb not bmw when bm finally decided to up hp lexus followed right alone let them catch mb in luxure game and then maybe theyll concentrate on performance not hp and 060    which 3 did you get 325 or 330 infiniti or at,pg48477
1081,September 2005,check out zainostorecom for answers zaino is a car polish system it is safe and will not void a paint warranty as unless im wrong there is no warranty just for paint confuse  great stuff especially for darker colors  13 jaguar xf possibly my favorite of all the cars ive owned but my 09 jag xk was a beauty as was my 05 acura tl 88 acura acura 84 mitsubishi mirage turbo  78 volkswagen scirocco my first and of course the 92 nissan nissan ser and 95 saab 900s i bought for the ex ok i like a lot of the cars in my life,laurasdada
1082,September 2005,its time to get back to the cars folks    those who are interested can continue the zaino connissantion at that link the future of the manual transmission will probably be of interest to a number of you and other offtopic subjects such as cardcounting in blackjack need another forum altogether    thanks,pat
1083,September 2005,handling definitely not  gas efficiency definitely not  ride no  room definitely not    wow when did you get your test drive any more details you could pass on why did you not like the ride did you mean too little room in the back or the front  oh wait maybe you didnt actually drive the car maybe you are just talking out of your  and do not have any actual emphirical data    haha before you get bent all out of shape you do realize that all posts here positive or negative are just speculation specs derivation and reviews derivation in fact we have 4473 posts of speculation i would think that this would be assumed    i also made speculative comments that were very favorable to the lexus yet you didnt have any beef about that or copypaste that i guess if its something positive about the is youre fine with it but if its negative god forbid       by the way i stand by my comments zero reviews so far have said that the lexus sets the class standard in handling we know that the lexus has less room than the pontiac5 tl and even the 330i and i will give you a cookie if the lexus has better mileage than the 330i    the only thing maybe that i might change my mind about is the ride component,jrock65
1084,September 2005,handling definitely not  gas efficiency definitely not  ride no  room definitely not    dont know how anyone can say definately not without test driving or at least seeing a car sure this forum has a lot of speculation i just find it strange that so many beemer cult members are taking shots at the new is if it is not real competition to the 3 serieswhy even bother to acknowledge such a lowly vehicle  in the final analysis the sales numbers will be all that countsand i think the is will be very successful    so if your mind is made up here is a review of the 3 series to confirm your admiration for the handling when you get past the handling aspects consider the other traitsoverall quality of the car enjoy    httpwwwthetruthaboutcarscomcontent11244693671382797373insubaruphp,rotoryfan
1085,September 2005,sorry for poor choice of words i meant rust perforation warranty 12 years,odessit
1086,September 2005,no a wax or polish shouldnt affect the rust perf warranty another reason not to buy rust proofing from the dealer    i think c and d has a history of forgiving overlooking build and reliability flaws for cars that they love to drive as its recent 50 year anninissanry issue has pointed out the mag basically started as an ode to british sports cars back in the 50s and as history has shown we all know how reliable and well built british cars were but they loved the driving experience and that was the thrust of the relationship    c and d noted the imperfections and because of their respect for the marque downplayed it as far as rating the new 3 imho of course what a cool comparo theres a car there for everyone    another thought bmw has been building bmw for a long time acura lexus and infiniti have been building bmw for what five years give em a bit more time and who knows the real winner you and me folks  13 jaguar xf possibly my favorite of all the cars ive owned but my 09 jag xk was a beauty as was my 05 acura tl 88 acura acura 84 mitsubishi mirage turbo  78 volkswagen scirocco my first and of course the 92 nissan nissan ser and 95 saab 900s i bought for the ex ok i like a lot of the cars in my life,laurasdada
1087,September 2005,are not hype  we all have different priorities and we are all entitled to them everyone here needs to recognize that someone elses priority is just as important to them as your own is to you and neither of you are right nor are you wrong    some of you folks need to calm down and stop making this so personal the cars are what they are and we make the choices we make to suit ourselves and not each other    we are here to compare the features of the cars in this class  not to beat each other over the head about our preferences and our choices,pat
1088,September 2005,it was a 212212 tie with the lexus    i have the october issue in my hands and the bmw outpointed the lexus by 213212    page 112 if it matters    regards  kyfdx  hostprices paid forums  moderator    prices paid lease questions suvs,kyfdx
1089,September 2005,acura lexus and infiniti have been building bmw for what five years    honda toyota and nissan have been trying to build bmw for a lot longer than that    and since the lexus is the fastest naturaly aspirated v6 sedan out there this can be easily defeated by bmw or infiniti  which bmw would this be     its not a v but its called the bmw,potemkin
1090,September 2005,awd is not class important just more hype from eastcoasters we in the left coast dont give a hoot about awd    it may not be a priority on the west coast but for some folks on the east it is the snowy east coast is a huge market that cant be ignored and if one looks around at the cars on the road the number of awd drive cars is huge not a small miniscule percentage    ride and handling the bimmer is good in this area but skimps mightily in other areas    i agree with that however the reason i like bmw is for what they dont put in a car in terms of luxoitems i dont need lexusbranded luxury nor do i want it i find the cockpit of the 3 series to be very calming and reassuring    but the fact that the 330i had a mechanical issue should have automatically been factored into the comparo    the fact it had a mechanical issue has no bearing on the way the car was designed to ride and drive and does ride and drive imo this is what they are measuring truthindisclosure they didnt hide it under the rug the reader can form any opinion they want on the mechanical issue,kdshapiro
1091,September 2005,and since the lexus is the fastest naturaly aspirated v6    that statement is true for now however slightly ot the bmw 32 liter i6 is the engine to beat in the naturally aspirated class the base bmw which is a few thousand more at 50k than the 350 and 330i will obliterate the cars in this segment,kdshapiro
1092,September 2005,so if your mind is made up here is a review of the 3 series to confirm your admiration for the handling when you get past the handling aspects consider the other traitsoverall quality of the car enjoy    httpwwwthetruthaboutcarscomcontent11244693671382797373insubaruphp    interesting thought that they gave the 3series 5 out of 5 star in performance ride and handling 4 out of 5 in desirability and 2 out of 5 in deisgn both of which are entirely subjective categories sound like they really liked the 3series except for the styling not sure how this backs up your point,bdr127
1093,September 2005,as blueguy so humorously pointed out unless you like to look at your reflection in passing buildings one livesdrives in the interior i really think reviewers ought to stick to the task of evaluating a car from a formfunction perspective and leave the stylingdesireability ratings out of the picture i dont need someone else to tell me if a car is beautiful or ugly,kdshapiro
1094,September 2005,what is subjective about having an electrical relay in the rain gutter of the front windshield    do you know why its there why is there even an issue unless this car was abused or crashed and a part became loose if not its under warranty for 4y50k    what is subjective about being charged more for keyless ignition that is really keyless    you dont have to buy the car if you dont like the vehicle options    what is subjective about the maintenance issues plaguing these expensive cars    yes i agree for the hundreds of thousands of bmw out there there will be some problems no car is immune the pontiac5 has certainly had its share as well and lets not even talk about the toyotalexus sludge and tranny issues the bmw also has a bb 4yr50k free maintenance progdodge along with the warranty    my point as it has always been is that these cars should be considered from a to z as a total package if reliability is not apparent how can best in class even be on the radar    who said reliability is not apparent because a test car had a malfunction thats like throwing the baby out with the bath water    wait dont tell me it handles well    it handles like its on rails and its selling like hotcakes,kdshapiro
1095,September 2005,ive done some heavy cleaning here im not sure that ive gotten every grimy detail but ive given it a good shot    lets see if the rest of you can help keep things neat and tidy around here     well try again and i hope and trust that those who want this discussion to remain viable will all pitch in    thanks,pat
1096,September 2005,all the talk on this forum seems to be about bmw infiniti lexus and acura why is nobody talking about the mercedes benz and cadillac are they that far out of this segment quality features cost etc,aaargh
1097,September 2005,mb and caddy are pretty much not players in this segment in my experience neither car is very nice handles very well or installs much confidence in their quality    id take a bimmer infiniti audi acura lexus before id even touch a caddy at 50 off msrp,blueguydotcom
1098,September 2005,while ive read that the cts offers a decent driving experience the exteriorinterior style and quality of interior materials is so offputting it never occurred to me to seriously shop it against the frontrunners here the entry level mbs have never seemed to be too exciting a driving experience save for amg models and they aint priced entry level anything nor a good value and yes there is a poor perception regarding gm and mb quality ive heard rumored  13 jaguar xf possibly my favorite of all the cars ive owned but my 09 jag xk was a beauty as was my 05 acura tl 88 acura acura 84 mitsubishi mirage turbo  78 volkswagen scirocco my first and of course the 92 nissan nissan ser and 95 saab 900s i bought for the ex ok i like a lot of the cars in my life,laurasdada
1099,September 2005,lsaturnsdada  i disagree about the cts i didnt test drive the v model but the driving experience and amenities were excellent loved the interior,kdshapiro
1100,September 2005,i havent driven the cts but have checked it out extensively at the auto show i really thought the interior was low rent typical gm i was truly surprised especially given the 40k window sticker the exterior is a basically handsome shape ruined by extra lines and layers mho of course and i believe it is selling well so gm may not be too concerned with mho    my dad loved driving his catera when it wasnt in the shop which unfortunately it was a lot he traded up to an 04 tl hes much happier  13 jaguar xf possibly my favorite of all the cars ive owned but my 09 jag xk was a beauty as was my 05 acura tl 88 acura acura 84 mitsubishi mirage turbo  78 volkswagen scirocco my first and of course the 92 nissan nissan ser and 95 saab 900s i bought for the ex ok i like a lot of the cars in my life,laurasdada
1101,September 2005,i found the interior of the cts to be plush without being annoying or distracting im guessing the car you saw at the auto show and the car i looked at had different interiors forgetting about the catera for a moment the cts and also in general the caddy lineup have decent interiors,kdshapiro
1102,September 2005,why is nobody talking about the mercedes benz and cadillac    excellent question it appears attending forum members are not so keen about the above marques myself included    what surprises me most is the lack of interest in audi the audi audi is one great performance vehicleespecially the upcoming 32fsi audi version i guess to each their own,dewey
1103,September 2005,hmmm guess well have to agree to disagree here actually bob lutz had a great quote about the cts interior to paraphrase he said we actually used very expensive materials in the cts interior we just made them look cheap it was in an issue of autoweek this summer perception is reality    the sts interior is better but it does cost a bit more compared to their peers well caddy needs to borrow a lexus designer and materials buyer  13 jaguar xf possibly my favorite of all the cars ive owned but my 09 jag xk was a beauty as was my 05 acura tl 88 acura acura 84 mitsubishi mirage turbo  78 volkswagen scirocco my first and of course the 92 nissan nissan ser and 95 saab 900s i bought for the ex ok i like a lot of the cars in my life,laurasdada
1104,September 2005,i think mbs are great looking cars but i cant overlook the reliability problems i thought the mb c230 handled great but again if its in the shop all the time what fun is    i agree i would take those cars over a caddy any day too although the caddy got some great reviews,frisconick
1105,September 2005,dead last in this segment the thing dipped and swayed in corners it was maddeningly softto the point of feeling like it was designed for an entirely different segment    the rest of the cars in this group track correctly and without ddodgea in corners to say i loathed my experience in the cts would be a gross understatement wretched wretched car worst salesperson ive encountered in years guy scoffed when i said i wanted to drive a manual he kept asking how i liked it and when i was honest placing it far below the competition posed by the g audi 3 series he would always offer the same answer ah but those arent cadillacs what does that mean should  i be impressed by a company name,blueguydotcom
1106,September 2005,my bad    pardon my last post with great honda i just determined that a audi is an inappropriate topic for a sedan forum sick,dewey

1108,September 2005,theres no reason to completely eliminate talk about sedan competitors that are not techincally sedans such as the audi the lines between body styles get blurrier and blurrier we shouldnt get too caught up in vehicles that arent strictly our subject but some side comparisons are fine ,pat

1110,September 2005,well thanks for the clarification about this topic    audi audi vs audi audi avant    cant imagine why anybody would buy the more expensive audi when the audi is the better performer and handler in addition audi interior space is almost equivalent to the audi avant  another advantage for most north americans who do not like manual is that the audi t has dsgan option that is unavailable in the current audi personally i prefer manual myself,dewey

1117,September 2005,despite the name of this forum i cant help but notice the emphasis among many forum members with mpg mpg has become as important as performance or luxury    also during the frankfurt show the ford was not so much on the new gasconsuming mb s series as on new fuel efficeincy endeavors by all attending auto makers is it mere coincidence that the two major exhibitsthe mb s series and the audi audi have futue hybrid versions in fact most of the excitement was reserved for any car that boosted fuel efficiency    definety the sign of the times    maybe sometime in the future the best performance luxury sedans available will not be defined by its performance or luxury the best future luxury performance sedan will be defined by how well it consumes gas at a given level of performanceluxury,dewey

1126,September 2005,yesterday i participated in the bmw ultimate driving experience at shea stadium nyc  pontiac5 w sport pkg 18 eagle ncts  audi audi 32 q 17 eagle f1s  bmw 330 18 potenza re050s  the audi had the best exhaust note the slowest acceleration the most body lean and ok room inside  the infiniti felt quickest had the most room inside understeered slightly more than the bmw and was more point and squirt  the bmw felt solid oversteered enough to be fun was tight inside and had uncomfortable hard rear seats  there was a big bump on the course that really upset the cars with the bmw tracking the best over it  on the street the 325 felt great in normal driving but the tight interior convinced me that i made the best choice for myself and my family by buying the pontiac5  oh well theres my 02  ps on the street the 540 was nice and roomy but the only word that comes to mind when describing the interior is sterile ill take an bmw5 or 45 any day the z4 just seemed like a toy not my cup of tea,joeshan

1134,September 2005,describing the interior is sterile    i like sterile when i drive less is more    maybe that wasnt quite the right word to use i also feel that the e90 does not have as attractive a view from the drivers seat as the e46 with its more cockpitlike feel the e90s interior is less unique more generic less traditional bmw it seems more similar to what you might find in an audi not that thats bad  just not distinctively bmw even the cd review mentioned something about not caring for dash design,gordonwd
1135,September 2005,true the e46 cockpit feel is missing in the e90 and that is a shame and the reason the e90 has become more generic is because it is less sterile than older bmw imo i favor sterilityfunctional designs over the ostentatioustrendy designs that are evident in all current performance sedans    drivetrainchassis considerations are what drives into showrooms styling is somewhere below my 25 top priorities in buying a car,dewey

1137,September 2005,is anyone in this forum old enough to remember when most people laughed when toyota introduced a luxury line called lexus    or a few years ago when many would never think that a korean samsung can outwit sony in consumer electronics    well here is something more current hyundai will be introducing a 35l rwd luxury sedan and should be on our shores early 07    httpwwwedmundscominsidelinedonewsarticleid107396,dewey
1138,September 2005,i keep mentioning hyundai pulling off what toyota done in the past 16 years so far people scoff so did bmwmb in the 80s theyre not laughing at lexus now    15 years from now will hyundai be the new lexus i wouldnt count them out theyve gone from 1980s joke much like toyota was a joke in the 60s to strong value contender in the 00s much like toyota in the 80s its not beyond the realm of possibility for the 2020 hyundai al760 entry luxury sport sedan with 1500 hp to be the big contender aiming to knock off infiniti and lexus aging but still popular platforms,blueguydotcom
1139,September 2005,yeah a lot of people just thought lexus was some gimmick    although it seems crazy now im sure that korean cars will be generally accepted by the public within 1015 years yeah its hard to imagine suzuki and hyundai as mainstream cars but they said the same thing about japanese in the 70s the american big 3 laughed and then proceeded to get run over in their complacency,bdr127
1140,September 2005,just as a slight correction to a possibly offtopic post suzuki is japanese not korean and they have long been one of the big four japanese motorcycle manufacturers current or up to recently at least korean brands include hyundai kia and daewoo,gordonwd
1141,October 2005,whats interesting to me but off the subject a bit are the 14mile numbers of these cars my first new car was a 1969 pontiac pontiac with a 400cid engine and i forget the hp rating it might have been 350hp but horsepower was rated a lot more optimistically in those days    anyway i took it to the drag strip a number of times and ran in the pure stock category which meant street tires and no engine mods the tires in those days were 14 bias ply tires and very skinny by todays standards i won my class a couple of times running 143 seconds  100mph the one time that i tried the car with a pair of cheater slicks on the back it went through at 139 seconds    anyway i am surprised in a way that todays performance cars are not all that much quicker in the quarter mile of course dont even start comparing ride  handling with those old beasts live axles nissan springs drum brakes etc,gordonwd
1142,October 2005,some of the 60s muscle cars probably didnt weigh any more in some cases less than a new compact like the is which runs about 3500 right traction was another big limiting facotr but that showed up more in 060 or et than in trap speed    at least the is will give you a bit better mpg than the old goat  2018 hyundai hyundai sport mine and 2013 acura acura awd wifes,stickguy
1143,October 2005,i am new to the luxury market and am considering the bmw 325 in an i or xi package and am also considering an infiniti pontiac5 first on the bmw i live in mn and on a hill do i really need the xi or can i get by with a good set of winter tires ive heard differing opinions on this but would like to save the  and performance of the i if i can second i drove the pontiac5 and was impressed in its relatively much stronger engine and overall value proposition i would be interested in hearing opinions from those of you out there who are more in the know,kschoenrock
1144,October 2005,i heard the same thing but only cds initial eval of the car and lexus seem to be able to get any numbers in the low 5s all other car mags that have tested the is seem to be getting in the mid and more likely upper 5s however i suspect that once a stick comes into the picture you may well see some low 5s,blue01s4
1145,October 2005,seems like you have to decide first what you want with bmw you are definitely paying for the name and less performance in comparison to the pontiac5 with the pontiac5 are you looking at the awd version or only the rwd in either configuration it seems the pontiac5 would be the better performer audi audi 20t would be another vehicle to consider if you want awd and comparable performance to the bimmer but i still think the pontiac5 would outperform the audi however the audi does have significantly more tuning potential compared to either car being that it is turbocharged if you are into that kinda thing     other things to consider are warranteies both audi and bmw include all service in their warranties whereas infiniti does not it may be something to factor into the price  do you mind paying more up front for 34 years of expense free driving or not then of course you get into talking about reliability and ill let you do the research on edmunds to come to your own conclusion about that    good luck,blue01s4
1146,October 2005,however i suspect that once a stick comes into the picture you may well see some low 5s    ummm what do you know that the rest of us dont last i heard the lexus was definitely not going to get a manual gearbox yes no    best regards  shipo,shipo
1147,October 2005,lexus has chevroletly stated that the 3 series bimmer was their target with this car they can not state that they have a bimmer killer with a conventional auto tranny  unless its a dsgsmgtype setup maybe they will have to put a stick into it im beting one to two years max anyway they said the original lexus was going to be an autoonly setup when they first released it also take what lexusianyoneonthisboard says with a grain of salt,blue01s4
1148,October 2005,lexus has chevroletly stated that the 3 series bimmer was their target with this car they can not state that they have a bimmer killer with a conventional auto tranny    so one would think i too remember early on when the folks at lexus stated that this new is would be a direct competitor to the 3series or some such language however everything that ive read over the last several months including stuff from lexus executives seems to indicate that they are backing off of that stance at this point i for one would be very surprised to see a new lexus with a true three pedal stick shift although a dsg type of tranny is i suppose not out of question    best regards  shipo,shipo
1149,October 2005,the lexus is a competitor to the tl and mb c class its not on the same level as a g or 3 series,blueguydotcom

1152,October 2005,plenty of people think they want a bmw but dont really like the experience when they get it    hmm ive heard of people getting porsches and sports cars and not liking them but never anyone buying a bmw and not liking it unless it gave them service headaches as far as the ride i think most people who buy them love them    by nature of the is size i think there was more room to suzukike some of the luxury formula for more sport especially with the back seat sized the way it is actually i think the is could be a new class of car a 222 whats the last 2 the back doors    ,designman

1156,October 2005,plenty of people think they want a bmw but dont really like the experience when they get it  ill tell you whati have a 9 year old e39 bmw 528 5spd with more than 132k miles on the clock and have been shopping for a new lps for the past six months i instantly ruled out another 5 series because i hate bangles styling i have tested the sts rl cts e350 audi gs and m guess what none of them is better than my old 528 none of them yes they have some new technology bits but as far as ride performance quietness solid construction reliability handling gas mileage roominess whatever they all have significant shortfalls yes some are better in one area or the other but overall none have the full set of attributes that my older car does in my opinion one thing is very clear bmw builds the very best road cars on the planet no one else is close for second place some may accelerate better have fancier interiors whatever but bmw owns the road because or mr bangles styling i may not replace my 97 e39 with another bmw but then i may just keep what i have bmw owners may complain about this or that but you wont find many complaining about how their cars drive,pearl
1157,October 2005,how about replacing it with a low mileage 2003 e39 the last year of that platform mine has been faultless and as you have attested has been a pleasure to drive sp is the only way to go  well a better way to go,lovemyclk
1158,October 2005,yes i believe bmw is their target but i am not convinced lexus understands what a bmw is    i can not agree with this statement more    mistakes imo lexus has made with regard to their pursuit of bmw with regard to sportinessperformance    awd is a great sporting application it offers great traction in all weather conditions however awd systems cause high amounts of drive line power loss  why would you only combine an awd system with your lower horsepower engine this is not consistent with a goal of producing a sportyperformance vehicle btw they did the same thing with the new gs    manual transmissions have always been associated with sportingperformance applications again why would you only offer a mt with your lower hp engine again this is not consistent with a goal of producing a sportyperformance vehicle    at least i have to commend them on making the vehicle rwd acura is still trying to make sporty fwd vehicles to compare with bmw though they do a fairly decent job of it    now for my bias you rarely see a japanese made vehicle outperform a comparable german made vehicle in any comparison infiniti seems to be the rare exception to the rule,blue01s4
1159,October 2005,now for my bias you rarely see a japanese made vehicle outperform a comparable german made vehicle in any comparison    you said it its a very biased statement the whole statement hinges on your defnition of outperform and comparable there are plenty japanese cars that out accelearate and outhandle german cars in the same size segment ultimately choosing a car is a balancing act among four things size sportiness accelearation and handling and luxury content all three balanced against cost german car makers historically have endeared itself to car rags by cheating on three out of four categories fielding a car that was substantially smaller than compeition 3 vs tl g es etc with less luxury content and interior plus at higher cost three out of four compromises made any wonder it would win in the fourth category    scientificly there are two ways of defining whats comaprable either by size or by cost the germans loses almost every time if either objective measures is held constant for comparison tl and g beats 5 e and audi on handling quite easily if size is the criterium for comparable tl and g beat 325 c230 and audi 1820 handily if price is the criterium for comparable it is only when one relaxes standards and bias the comparable in favor of the germans that they would win compros any wonder in the rigged result if you are willing to spend moreny more on a smaller car with less luxury chances are indeed good that you will get better handling unless the mfr is utterly incompetent,brightness04
1160,October 2005,if you are willing to spend moreny more on a smaller car with less luxury chances are indeed good that you will get better handling    as long as the size of the car is big enough for the target market it doesnt matter that the e90 is smaller than the is theyre both big enough personally i think the pontiac5 is too big  more of a midsize car pretending very well mind you to be compact    luxury is more than just feature content luxury in large part is qualified by the feel of an automobile how refined is the drivetrain how quiet is the interior how solid is the body structure how well does the suspension absorb impacts andor transmit them to the cockpit how do the doors feelsound when you shut them what do the plastics lookfeel like how smoothly do the controls operate    an e90 with vinyl seats and halogen headlights may be lacking some features one expects to have in an entrylevel luxury car but it is definitely a luxurious where it really matters    it really boils down to individual priorities size amenities handling acceleration refinement all of these cars offer a different mix of them,fedlawman
1161,October 2005,heres the thing though the japanese mfrs are theoretically just as competent to make a great performing small or medium sized sedan as the germans are so why do they not make direct competition for the germans as you said the 3 series is quite a bit smaller than the tl g es i cant believe you even mentioned the es  what car has that thing ever out performed so why not compete directly with them the acura is similar in size to the 3 series but acura gives it a relatively weak engine makes it fwd and what do you expect it doesnt compete with regard to the tl and g which 5 e or audi will they beat with regards to performance thats another imo problem with japanese mfrs  they give you limited choices you can get an audi 32 audi 42 s6 soon or rs6 in a few years and similar options exist with bmw and mb will the tl out perform all of them obviously not you dont have to be that biased or at all to see that in regards to handlingperformance and i dont just mean straight line german cars generally out perform comparable japanese cars  imho of course  dont take this as a personal assault i like japanese cars and would readily buy one but it has to perform and in the cars ive compared they generally havent kept up,blue01s4

1164,October 2005,you can get an audi 32 audi 42 s6 soon or rs6 in a few years and similar options exist with bmw and mb will the tl out perform all of them obviously not you dont have to be that biased or at all to see that in regards to handlingperformance and i dont just mean straight line german cars generally out perform comparable japanese cars  imho of course    once again it hinges on your definition of comparable rs6 is a 7080k car are you seriously comparing that to a 30k japanese car and call yourself unbiased what you call options in the forms of s6 and rs6 are nothing more than a waste of money for the overwhelming majority of buyers of audi the sales of s4rs4 and s6rs6 combined dont even make up 10 of their audiaudi volume and can never get their rd money back what you call options are really the elimination of the very practical option of being able to get the audi or audi at an otherwise lower price and the even more critically important option of getting an audi or audi that is reliable the plethra of nonstandardization is the big reason behind german unreliability and high cost    i cant believe you even mentioned the es  what car has that thing ever out performed    btw the es out performed 318s of its time quite well in typical american street and highway driving conditions it certainly did better than the audi 28 quatro that could not even get out of its own way and accounted for the overwhelming majority of audi sales for a long time,brightness04

1171,November 2005,we were not talking about the 330xi i was responding to the comment from dave330i that the pontiac5x had a weaker suspension i was asking him compared to what is it weaker,mnrep2
1172,November 2005,weaker suspension as compared to what    pontiac5x has a weaker suspension compaired to pontiac5    awd is marketing at its best or worst since most of the people getting it dont need it    the pontiac5x sits a little higher than the standard rwd pontiac5 but that is so you can go better in deep snow when your 330i or a tl are spinning their wheels because their suspension is too low    tell me how often are you expecting deep snow each year maybe 1 5 10 or 15 days for those once in a blue moon days youre willing to sacrifice performace the rest of the year,dave330i
1173,November 2005,it has gotten to the point where i firmly believe anyone disparaging awd has not owned a performance rearwheel biased awd system porsche the worlds most prestigious sports car maker offers awd on their 911and set the world on fire with the awd 959 in 86 the skyline gtr is legendarythe pontiac5xs system is derived from that experience    and in case you wonder from what experience i speak i have a top 10 road racing plate hanging on my wall and dislike unnescessary weight as much as the next racer on a road car in most climates in the us awd is a great feature despite the extra weight and has numerous advantages other than just deep snow,sdiver68
1174,November 2005,dave330i awd is actually very useful for driving in snow and ice you dont experience that in sunny ca much but in the northeast or the midwest awd is not a marketing gimmick awd is not just useful in high snow but hilly icy driveways left turns across busy streets you get the idea awd offers a substantial traction advantage for street driving i dont think there is a large advantage from the rwd pontiac5 to the x especially for 90 of the drivers out there if your talking auto cross or track performance then there are advantages to a smaller lighter rwd package calling the standard pontiac5x suspension softer than the sport pontiac5 suspension is a reasonable comparison    however i was responding to al57 who is comparing the fwd tl vs the pontiac5 and asking for help with his decsion in snowy regions my opinion is that the awd pontiac5x offers handling advantages over the fwd tl the x is primarily rwd and does not suffer from torque steer like the tl in the end buy what you like not what someone on the internet thinks you should buy,mnrep2
1175,November 2005,it has gotten to the point where i firmly believe anyone disparaging awd has not owned a performance rearwheel biased awd system    i wasnt trying to disparage awd system i disagree with people who automatically assume they need awd because it snows on occasion    porsche the worlds most prestigious sports car maker offers awd on their 911and set the world on fire with the awd 959 in 86    and yet they only offer gt2  gt3 in rwd only    on a road car in most climates in the us awd is a great feature despite the extra weight and has numerous advantages other than just deep snow    i believe right tire is a better choice than awd vs rwd vs fwd for most drivers    if you can get better performance with awd great i prefer rwd and ill stick with it,dave330i
1176,November 2005,dave330i awd is actually very useful for driving in snow and ice you dont experience that in sunny ca much but in the northeast or the midwest awd is not a marketing gimmick    i lived in northeast until 2000 without awd just fine    awd is not just useful in high snow but hilly icy driveways left turns across busy streets you get the idea awd offers a substantial traction advantage    again how often will you expericen bad weather even if its 60 days thats still 300 days where rwd will be better than awd    for street driving i dont think there is a large advantage from the rwd pontiac5 to the x especially for 90 of the drivers out there    if youre interested in a performance sedan you should be able to feel the difference between rwd  awd    however i was responding to al57 who is comparing the fwd tl vs the pontiac5 and asking for help with his decsion in snowy regions my opinion is that the awd pontiac5x offers handling advantages over the fwd tl    i guess i should have been more clear i was trying to get al57 to consider pontiac5 as an alternative to pontiac5x or tl    in the end buy what you like not what someone on the internet thinks you should buy    very true,dave330i
1177,November 2005,i guess i should have been more clear i was trying to get al57 to consider pontiac5 as an alternative to pontiac5x or tl    al57 was comparing the rwd pontiac5 to the fwd tl in his post i was suggesting he consider the x sometimes i think we all rush to type an answer with our not so humble opinions before really reading what the question was    a very good way to compare fwd tl to the pontiac5x is to drive both especially on snow covered roads this can help you make an educated decision end of my not so humble opinion,mnrep2
1178,November 2005,maybe 1 5 10 or 15 days     to that way of thinking its like saying its hot only 2 months of the year why do i need airconditioning    the answer is  if i need it once it already paid for itself    i lived in northeast until 2000 without awd just fine    i also lived in sunny ca for a brief stint and admitedly awd doesnt have much of an advantage there but in the northeast in the last 10 years i lost track of the number of times i limped along and was concerned about getting stuck in very deep snow with awd getting stuck is no longer a concern unless one does something very very stupid,kdshapiro
1179,November 2005,with awd getting stuck is no longer a concern unless one does something very very stupid    the same could also be said for any decent car with a good set of winter tires many choose to change the odds by opting for an allseason equiped car with awd some things get better some get worse while others are willing to spend enough to changed the odds even more by opting for awd and winter tires    which is best it depends upon where you live how you drive and the conditions that you are willing to drive in    consider this three winters ago my california born and raised wife had never driven in snow in a rwd car in her life although she did have a little fwd experience that winter i broke my right leg which prohibited me from driving a car with a manual transmission and as such the situation required us to swap cars i just positioned my casted right leg over in the passengers footwell of her car and drove left footed wouldnt you know it that winter here in southern new hampshire mother nature threw 114 of snow at us forcing her to drive my winter tire shod 530i back and forth to work round trip nearly 70 miles through it all she never got stuck never was unable to make it to work or home in fact she never had a single problem so much so that she threatened to break my other leg when i got out of my cast so that she could keep driving the bmw snow or no snow    with that in mind i continually have to ask why when folks insist that they need an awd equipped car because they live in the north east sorry not buying    best regards  shipo,shipo
1180,November 2005,so much so that she threatened to break my other leg when i got out of my cast so that she could keep driving the bmw snow or no snow    lol does she have any other reasons to want to keep you hobbling    with that in mind i continually have to ask why when folks insist that they need an awd equipped car because they live in the north east sorry not buying    agreed as a lifelong new englanderskier fwdallseason tires and a modicum of intelligenceskillexperience when driving in snow not that i reserve my intelligence for the snow or so i believe has kept me going and arriving safe and sound lo these many years a flatlander in the greenwhite mountains of beautiful maine new hampster and vermont    awd is a nicety not a necessity but it will never cease to amaze me the number of drivers that believe awd overrules the laws of physics eg subaru subaru wagon  snow  excessive speed after having tailgated me and illegally passed  sharp lefthanded curve rte 103 into ludlow vt  subaru firmly planted in a snow bank on the town green i did stop to see if all were ok besides the subie they were and i continued to my destination in my fwd acura without incident  13 jaguar xf possibly my favorite of all the cars ive owned but my 09 jag xk was a beauty as was my 05 acura tl 88 acura acura 84 mitsubishi mirage turbo  78 volkswagen scirocco my first and of course the 92 nissan nissan ser and 95 saab 900s i bought for the ex ok i like a lot of the cars in my life,laurasdada
1181,November 2005,i test drive 7 cars recently i am looking at here is how i would rate them    1 acura tl  2 lexus is 350  3 infiniti pontiac5  4 bmw 325i  5 cadillac cts  6 mercedes benz c class  7 lincoln lincoln,starman98
1182,November 2005,neat care to expand on your rating mehod or pros and cons,bplayer
1183,November 2005,the same could also be said for any decent car with a good set of winter tires    we just disagree on this point with rwd with snows or without snows you slip the dsc or whatever kicks in and engine power gets cut if needed if you dont have dsc tailspin    with awd4wd depending on the system of course traction gets transferred to the front wheels its simply more secure    besides being more secure imo of course i dont want to swap rims and tires,kdshapiro
1184,November 2005,absolutely agree no car regardless of how capable is a substitute for the matter between the ears thinking back on an old it help desk industry acronym pebkac problem exists between keyboard and chair i might humbly suggest that we might want to coin a new acronym for drivers that stuff awd and 4wd equipped cars into snowbanks or worse hmmm how about pebsapos problem exists between seat and pedals or steeringwheel    best regards  shipo,shipo
1185,November 2005,we just disagree on this point with rwd with snows or without snows you slip the dsc or whatever kicks in and engine power gets cut if needed if you dont have dsc tailspin    well that seems to be a fairly common belief around here however i drove any number of rwd equipped cars through lots of snow in the days before abs dsc tcs or any of the alphabet soup electronic nannies were applied to the generally affordable automobile industry and i never tailspinned errr unintentionally that is     true if you simply mash the throttle without regard to the conditions around you then tailspin is the least of your worries the fact is that there are many millions of drivers whove driven nonnannied rwd cars billions of miles in wintry conditions without even a single tailspin    best regards  shipo,shipo
1186,November 2005,thinking about my last post a little more the only car that ive ever had an unintentional spin in was in my 1979 volkswagen scirocco of course that was on dry pavement and i was pushing a little hard blush    best regards  shipo,shipo
1187,November 2005,70miles commute on highways dont count for squat because both nh and ma are very diligent about ploughing highways and the dodgeps are always very well designed i drove 200 miles from boston to nyc more than a decade ago in an old bmw 5 series no dsc or lsd with bald allseason tires in a snow storm    when i stopped for a bathroom break and a sandwich lunch the headlights were buried by the snow on the bumper when i came out i should not have done that except for youthful inexperiencebravado and the snow storm was sudden    still i made it without incident or even much wheel slippage at all simply because the road was very well salted even as the snow coming down rapidly    half a decade later when i had to drive in the boonie back country it was an entirely different matter the back roads of the hilly parts of new england most certainly need awd because the local authorities dont plough for days at a time    awd is a nicety not a necessity    awd is certainly more necessary than either luxury or performance or the sedan part for that matter can we just move on from this religiosity against awd,brightness04
1188,November 2005,interesting dichotomy you present dave 330i    you advocate winter tiresdespite the fact they will need to be on the car from decmarch even in the midwestand have horrible performance in the dry so basically you advocate turning you performance sedan into an econobox for 45 months out of the year instead of awd    then you say if youre interested in a performance sedan you should be able to feel the difference between rwd  awd    im sorry but this just does not hold up in my experience ever go to a pca or bmw track event ever notice how 80 of the cars out there are dangerous rolling obstacles ever go to an autocross and find 12 the drivers turning in times slower than what i could achieve on my pit scooter these are people who are not only interested in performance but trying to do something to improve theirs and they make up what maybe 3 of drivers of performance cars and these are the people who are going to notice a couple of hundred pounds on the road at a safe 80 of their ability,sdiver68
1189,November 2005,and yet they only offer gt2  gt3 in rwd only    in case you did not know gt2 and gt3 are offered in rwd only because the respective race cars are rwd why are the race cars rwd because awd has been banned from these races due to the unfair advantage in other words when awd were allowed the rwd entrants had no realistic hope of winning the races when driving in the snow by myself i want every unfair advantage there is,brightness04
1190,November 2005,the fact is that there are many millions of drivers whove driven nonnannied rwd cars billions of miles in wintry conditions without even a single tailspin    another fact is that hundreds of thousands of old rwd cars have gone off the road or flipped over in snow conditions the success of fwd cars in snow racing in the 50s and 60s and the success and ultimately the banning of awd cars due to their unfair advantage from car races should have made it plenty clear that rwd platform is not ideal when surface traction is limited as much as i love rwd cars i find it perplexing why some other rwd afficienadoes find it necessary to argue against simple physics,brightness04
1191,November 2005,70miles commute on highways dont count for squat because both nh and ma are very diligent about ploughing highways    youre pretty funny the fact is that not even the best snow removal team in the world can keep up with 18 of snow in 6 hours some hours were as much as 6 that and the fact that we live a fair distance from any major roads meaning that any commute for us requires a fairly long run on a two lane road that winds its way through hill and dale even when the interstate finally does get cleared its usually several hours before the plows get to our neighborhood    best regards  shipo,shipo
1192,November 2005,another fact is that hundreds of thousands of old rwd cars have gone off the road or flipped over in snow conditions     i find myself wondering if fwd and awd cars have fared any better the fact is that if you put a nut behind the wheel regardless of the car the odds are good that said nut is going to find a snow bank sooner or later    i find it perplexing why some other rwd afficienadoes find it necessary to argue against simple physics    so whos arguing against simple physics not me the fact is that ive driven nearly a million miles over the years in all sorts of 2wd cars through it all the most capable car that ive ever driven in the snow was my 530i when shod with winter tires true some other cars may have been able to do something a little better but for the overall go turn stop envelope that encompasses the winter driving regimen give me a rwd car with a 5050 weight balance and winter tires    best regards  shipo,shipo
1193,November 2005,distance is nowhere nearly as important as slopes just because you can get by without awd dont expect everyone else can as well i lived in ma for over a decade with rwd and allseason tires sometimes very bald did that make it right for me to proclaim that snow tires are not necessary then a move to the hills demonstrated awd and snow tires are both necessities for a lot of people in new england,brightness04
1194,November 2005,find myself wondering if fwd and awd cars have fared any better the fact is that if you put a nut behind the wheel regardless of the car the odds are good that said nut is going to find a snow bank sooner or later    you dont have to wonder about it at all given the same degree of nuttiness rwd goes off the road first followed by fwd followed by awd followed by halftracks you only need to find a point at which you are comfortable somewhere in that spectrum if your choice is rwd thats fine for you just dont go around telling people your rwd car is the best traction device in the world    so whos arguing against simple physics not me    yes you are every time you argue that rwd is every bit as good as awd for traction either that or you are making nonpoints    the fact is that ive driven nearly a million miles over the years in all sorts of 2wd cars    so what i can give you one simple stretch of quater mile that your rwd 530i can not passibly make it in fact rwd snow tires or no snow tires is banned from numerous mountain passes across the country you can drive on flat land in dry ground all you want    still does not prove that your rwd is every bit as good as awd when it gets slippery    through it all the most capable car that ive ever driven in the snow was my 530i when shod with winter tires    capable as defined by what you are obviously trying to change the topic if it is the most capable in the snow that you have ever had then you have not had any real snow cars    true some other cars may have been able to do something a little better but for the overall go turn stop envelope that encompasses the winter driving regimen give me a rwd car with a 5050 weight balance and winter tires    a 530xi with regular all season tires can probably clean the clock with your 530i in 90 of winter driving conditions where neither awd nor snow tire is strictly necessary yet your car is stuck with snow tires for the remaining 10 or 1 going up slippery hills the difference is so great as to be laughable,brightness04
1195,November 2005,oh by the way fresh snow is usually not a problem even if 18 in 6hrs like i said i drove down from boston to nyc in a rwd without no dsc or lsd in a snow storm and on nearlybald all season tires while the snow was coming down so fast that a quick lunch break was enough to put enough snow on the bumper to cover up the headlights the drive was actually pretty simple just follow the tracks made the by cars in front me flat highway busy traffic actually makes snow driving a piece of cake even on my bald all season tires    its the overnight packed down refrozen stuff on back country hilly roads that is dangerous,brightness04
1196,November 2005,in my opinion driver skill and common sense are the most important aspects of negotiating the winter stuff a good driver who also plans his time on road will certainly get by splendidly with rwd that said there is no comparison between awd and the rest none is it necessary depends on the buyer for those who are not particularly good drivers i recommend it highly my wife is an active person and i feel much better about her traipsing around in the winter with awd,designman
1197,November 2005,move south we rarely get snow  usually just a 2 day ice storm and everything gets cancelled anyway we dont need awd we need law enforcement on the roads atlanta perimeter speed limit is as fast as you can go before you hit the next bottleneck and the tl feels great  95 mph,goodegg
1198,November 2005,congratulations on surviving the trip despite your lack of regard for safety    even if you dont feel that your life is worth the cost of a set of tires with tread most other drivers on the road would appreciate you stay off the road if you dont have good tires because regardless of you opinion you cannot drive safely without tread mad,pgsmith
1199,November 2005,very true the need is highly dependent on the driver besides skills i would add more importantly the likelihood of having to drive in bad road conditions ie how important is it for you to show up on time regardless snow or sleet no not talking about going to a holiday party but the type of job you have,brightness04
1200,November 2005,point well taken that trip was made over a decade ago looking back it was pure youthful folly i would never do such a thing again nor do i encourage anyone to try nowadays i drive with awd and plenty treads the mud and snow variety and encourage everyone to do the same if you live in places that are likely to see unploughed snow sitting overnight turning into packed slick surface,brightness04
1201,December 2005,i was under the impression that the cayenne was one of the least reliable suvs out there    porsche actually has one of the worst jd power initial quality ratings but also has one of the best dependability ratings so go figure confuse,bdr127
1202,December 2005,i was talking about porsches not a volkswagen suv thats not a porsche thats just an embarassingly ugly junk pilejust like the x3x5    porsche cars are scary reliable porsche truckswell theyre volkswagens so you cant expect much,blueguydotcom
1203,December 2005,errr sorry not buying the hill has to be both very steep and very slippery before it becomes an issue    hmm if the is not very steep or very slippery both awdrwd and allseasonwintertires can handle it all whats the point of the discussion again we are talking about extreme driving conditions where traction is an issue otherwise whats the point of the discussion    youre making this up as you go arent you obviously you dont have any actual experience with buying and driving on winter tires    thank you for letting me on the news i have had experience with winter tires ever since my 1982 bmw 528e its been more than half a dozen cars since then for me,brightness04
1204,December 2005,yeah but if you have to do repairs it probably costs a mint    even maintenance is probably costly at porsche specialist shops,wco81
1205,December 2005,supposedly prototype to make its debut at ny auto show with 330 hp host of questions    its engine answers the volley from lexus but will it have the chassis to match 3 infiniti fans certainly expect so since it reportedly borrows a lot from upcoming gtr and considering chassis of 5 and m are very closely matched    most people dont need 330 horses will there be a infiniti what will infiniti do to inacuraate its v8 45 to put distance between its v6 and v8    theres an obvious power war between lexus and infiniti will acura have to ditch its sohc to join the war what will audi and mb have to do with their v6s or risk being left behind bmw might just want to do its own thing with its i6,mariner7
1206,December 2005,its engine answers the volley from lexus but will it have the chassis to match 3 infiniti fans certainly expect so since it reportedly borrows a lot from upcoming gtr and considering chassis of 5 and m are very closely matched    i do not think infiniti needs to answer to lexus why does the chassis need to match 3  gtr has a pretty good chassis of its own and i do not think gtt should be compared to 3 it should be compared to 911 or z06 i think bmw 5 and bmw have the same chassis    most people dont need 330 horses will there be a infiniti what will infiniti do to inacuraate its v8 45 to put distance between its v6 and v8    i do not think 330 is enough i need 400 p  too many cars and engines will hurt your sales because of the huge overhead    theres an obvious power war between lexus and infiniti will acura have to ditch its sohc to join the war what will audi and mb have to do with their v6s or risk being left behind bmw might just want to do its own thing with its i6    i think the power war is among all the manufacturers not just between lexus and infiniti because it is the simplest way to give you cars more values without raising the price  honda will only offer v8 when there is a need and again there is not a need not now or ever on the street  audi audi has a new v6 and mb e350 has a new v6 as well  bmw 3 series have a new v6 too no one is left behind,proe
1207,December 2005,bmw 3 series have a new v6 too    in fact it is a new inline 6 cylinder engine    now i guess the most exciting new car worth waiting for will be the infiniti infiniti,dewey
1208,December 2005,do not think infiniti needs to answer to lexus why does the chassis need to match 3    because right now the pontiac5s chassic cant compare to the e90 or even e46 the chassis high ride height and roughness of the vq drove me to bmw if infiniti can fix those issues ill gladly come back to nissan      i do not think 330 is enough i need 400  too many cars and engines will hurt your sales because of the huge overhead    tell that to bmw mb lexus and audi a 30 pontiac5 with 240 hp would sell just fine a 35 with 320 would be the next bump everybody but acura and infiniti exist using the dual engine sales model,blueguydotcom
1209,December 2005,having done much research and quite a few test drives its down to the line between acura tl and lexus es 330 but the issue that might tip the balance is mpg and gasoline given that gas may well rise to back to postkatrina levels it seems to make more sense to go for lexus  with slightly higher mpg and a regular gas consumer to boot sacrificing the slightly greater responsiveness of the tl anyone care to weigh in on this,elliedog
1210,December 2005,youre worrying about gas prices in this price range of cars,goodegg
1211,December 2005,i dont see any real difference on the mpg maybe you see something different than what edmunds is showing so it comes down to premium vs regular which is what 025 a gallon if that what are you saving couple of hundred a year if you are 15k a year driver    if youre indifferent between the cars go for the lower gas costs i guess i wouldnt think that if you can lay out over 30k out the door for a car that this savings would mean a whole heck of lot i would say throw out the gas issue and pick the car you like the most seems like a nonstarter to me,mwhitt
1212,December 2005,i dont get why you worry about gas prices its gone up for a while and people are still driving like crazy the diff between 87 and 91 is 20 thats only 250 diff for every 10 gallons mpg also depends on how you drive as well i can get better mpg in the tl than other ppl can in the es i think my 330i sucks a lot of gas but i dont complain i mean if youre gonan spend 3040k on a car whats another 15 a month,saigonboi21
1213,December 2005,elliedog    imo i really enjoyed test driving the es and thought it was luxurious solid and a comfortable drive that being said yes you need only put in regular gasoline in the lexus but to say that the acura has only slightly greater responsiveness is a misstatement in my opinion the tl although fwd is in a different category than the es as far as performance is concerned btw are you prepared to spend 3000035000 this year on a vehicle that is getting remodeled for 06,ggesq
1214,December 2005,i agree with all of the points made by those who commented before me i would particularly emphasize that there is no slightly greater responsiveness of the tl over the es its significantly greater responsiveness imho if you are a very conservative driver and are more interested in a soft ride than handling maybe the lexus is the best choice for you,jinva
1215,December 2005,the es is getting todally redesigned in spring 2006 so be care of thatyou will be buying a car ready to be redesigned soon    the new ones will have better power more features and hopefully a better sound system as the base in the es was nothing great,starman98
1216,December 2005,you can put regular in your tl is you want and it may reduce its performance to es330 levels mileage will probably drop also i agree with the others these cars are really not the same at all in terms of driving dynamics,lmacmil
1217,December 2005,why is it that anytime we do a comparo discussion we only compare new cars    why not compare a brand new cts with a threyear old 7series for example or something that would cost about the same as the new cts    i know some of us only want new but some of us are in the i have 40k to spend on a car and i want something cool and sporty and luxurious wed consider a used car,calidave
1218,December 2005,fire up a new discussion on that subject if it interests you,pat
1219,December 2005,because the vast majority of people on this  related boards lease the reasons vary but the fact that being without warranty coverage on european cars in this price range makes sphincters tighten is very high on the hit parade right behind not being able to actually afford the car in the first place    me i buy cars im with you all the way    buying an offlease 3639 month old car is a very good idea but only for those with good longterm reliability that you dont think have been abused standard transmission cars with sport packages dont fall into that category so its not a good choice for me,cdnpinhead
1220,December 2005,because the vast majority of people on this  related boards lease    is that true i did not know that seriously    cant you get a bmw warranty on a used bmw,calidave
1221,December 2005,yes and no you can get a bmw cpo but for a very high price in the end i wouldnt trust an offlease car mixed with it being german nobody else makes cars that are as engaging imho so the choices become few and far between    with my car ill turn it in then bmw will cpo it and resell the bucket of bolts to some poor guy hell drop 2829k for a car that will fulfill his friends negative comments on german cars,blueguydotcom
1222,December 2005,hi all    im thinking about either the lexus awd or a bmw 330xi this is my first new car purchase in a long time went to the lexus dealership for a test drive i live in chicago and there was a dusting of snow on the ground  nothing remotely serious    first strange thing the guy coming in from his test drive remarks that the driver assist feature came on during his test drive i didnt pay much attention however i was taking a pretty easy turn which would not have been a problem for my old toyota and the is slipped on the turn causing the driver assist feature to kick in    this disturbed me i dont think though i have little experience the 330xi would have done that could this just be a tire issue or is this driver assist system screwed up    has anyone else experienced this with the is or has anyone driven the is in snow i like the features for price of the is though it feels a little cdodgeped but i really liked the way the bmw drove felt very firm and controlled however it wasnt snowing when i test drove the bmw    i have never owned either a lexus or a bmw thanks for any help or experience    wiggling,wiggling
1223,December 2005,hi wiggling  welcome sounds like the discussion at this link is just what you need 2006 bmw 3series vs 2006 lexus is enjoy,pat
1224,December 2005,i have a 325i not xi in the detroit area and so far have gotten along ok with the standard allseason tires through one winter although this year is looking like it could be a lot worse anyway my impression is that the more recent stability controllers are getting more sensitive and tend to kick in with very little slippage in some cases i guess this is good but i find that i often prefer turning off the dsc and letting the car spin its wheels and fishtail a little bit    with the dsc on i had a couple instances of pulling out from a slippery side street onto a main road when the dsc kicked in and caused the car to feel like the engine just bogged down bivolkswagenme and there i was trying to get into a moving flow of traffic with no power id prefer a little wheelspin and im fully capable of keeping it moving in the right direction    so dont let the stability controls kicking in unfairly color your opinion of either car even though the bmw is the obvious choice ,gordonwd
1225,December 2005,sorry if this goes out of topic but if your car  has more than normal reliability issues and has been in repair shop many many times would bmw still cpo it in any case shouldnt its resell value reflect this fact,bear1234
1226,December 2005,id be willing to bet theyll cpo it who knows for certain    btw im not sure my reliability problems are viewed as problems by bmw they dont feel the engine stutter is a problem as they simply refuse to fix it    the coils sensors and blown light bulbs were all considered no big deal as theyre known issues with e46s    the broken ebrake from the factory was probably viewed as a factory default    the electrical problemswell my dealer seems to think that its not immediately repoducible and therefore not a problem either,blueguydotcom
1227,December 2005,i tested my new 2006 mercedes benz c350 luxury wo 4matic for mileage at a rocksteady 65 mph on level freeway cruise controlled and clocked an amazing 341 mpg within 22 miles it may have exceeded this but my commute destination had already arrivedbut with my normally unhealthy driving habits rushcentric i am averaging about 245 mpg the car is officially rated 2029 on cityfreeway i have yet to complete 1 month of ownership    does anyone have the realworld mpg numbers for comparable 3series pontiac5 or lexus ,shanky
1228,December 2005,on my 330i 6 speed i get over 30 mpg on long freeway drives averaging 95100 mph ive never tried going 65 on the freeway so i cant say what sort of mileage my 330i would get at that speed,blueguydotcom

1232,January 2006,they know revealing the pontiac5 sedan too soon will spoil sales of the 2006s argh    the pontiac5 coupe addresses some visual issues i had with the original  namely the lack of a character line wow stunning seriously stunning    oh april is so far away,blueguydotcom
1233,January 2006,i was expecting more of the concept theyve shown it looks like a warmed over version or a facelift of the current pontiac5 coupe to me i like the new front end but the rear more or less looks the same to me now that interior is a night and day difference to the current car even when they tone it down for production it will be way better than current    m,merc1
1234,January 2006,anyone have any other ideas as to what i should look at    suburu subaru gt,lmacmil
1235,January 2006,i had a 2004 nissan i wanted a little more luxury i drove the 2006 mercedes benz c350 three times ordered one and put a 4000 deposit on it in september it was still not built as of 123105 my neighbor suggested i look at the 2006 volkswagen volkswagen 36l i laughed at him but went for a test drive anyway it was equal to or better than the mercedes benz across the board and 10000 less to boot i got my deposit back from mercedes benz and bought the volkswagen on 1506 best decision i ever made    thank you mercedes benz for not building my car,150mphclub
1236,January 2006,great that you are happy with the volkswagen 36l    mb does have delays in building the c350mine too took about 3 monthsbut hey to me it was definitely worth it i am over 4800 blazing miles now,shanky
1237,January 2006,you are just the type of buyer volkswagen wants one who looked at the higher priced german iron and found it to be lacking for whatever reason then purchases a volkswagen volkswagen    i just wonder if there are enough of you to make the volkswagen the volume seller volkswagen wants it to be well actually there are two groups you who looked up mb and didnt buy then there is the group that looked down  hondatoyota etc and found those brands lacking and deceided to spend more money on a volkswagen    very risky strategy for volkswagen imo but i see the new volkswagen everday now many of them    m,merc1

1239,January 2006,the gli is not in the same league as anything in the entry lux class its a sloppy handling understeering rollypolly toyota lookalike with typical volkswagen engineering ie bad    but seriously blueguy what do you really think of the gli    you call that thinking not a word of it is true tell it to car and driver who consider the gli tops in its class,ambull
1240,January 2006,who buys a car based on what c  d thinks,jimmy81
1241,January 2006,c  d is just a magazine i dont buy based on reviews i buy based on how the car responds to me drive the car for yourself unfortunately i experienced the displeasure of driving a gli and its exactly as i described it in my extensive review posted months ago great engine great tranny lousy handling theyve improved it from the last gli with the cruddy 6 speed and lousy vr6 at least maybe by gen vi they can make a gli that doesnt drive like a pillbug on wheels,blueguydotcom
1242,January 2006,i just drove it yesterday  handling is great very taut instant torque a real pleasure i only quote car  driver because they get cars together and compare sidebyside which is hard for consumers to do and theyre performanceoriented but want luxury too like me    i would like to read your review though just for laughs,ambull
1243,January 2006,i guess we can add handling to the list of subjective characteristics one mans very taut is someone elses pillbug on wheels,lmacmil
1244,January 2006,quoting edmunds first drive test  highspeed stability was excellent    when the road does turn the electromechanical steering is tight and sporty offering excellent feedback and feel and the suspension which has thicker antiroll bars gives the car a hunkereddown planted feeling in the corners push too hard and radical understeer rears its ugly head but the car is easy to drive quickly and much more fun than we thought it would be    i didnt push hard enough to induce understeer but otherwise i agree sorry no mention of pillbug,ambull
1245,January 2006,well i just drove the 06 volkswagen here are my impressions    nice fit and finish decent interior power in the volkswagen with 18s package 1 and dsg was ample dsg was just as fun and snappy as ever unfortunately the car sits too high and the suspension causes too much understeer in hard cornering nosedive was ample in corners and the car due to the inherent problems of fwd couldnt pull out of corners fast enough for me overall a nice car good power great tranny but ultimately far too soft for my liking    bummer i wanted to like it as it was last hope,blueguydotcom
1246,January 2006,i didnt push hard enough to induce understeer but otherwise i agree sorry no mention of pillbug    thats hilarious you admittedly drove the car sedately and then come back at me for tearing down the cars high speed performance characteristics    as someone else mentioned one mans taunt car is anothers sloppy jallopy the 06 gli for people who drive as if medicated will feel tight and fun    i tend to push my cars far more the end result then most cars to me feel undrivable on my drive of the volkswagen the salesman was shocked that i didnt like the car he commented that nobody on his test drives has pushed the car as hard as i or as smoothly he actually wanted to know if i race in autox or semiprofessionally he expected i would have liked it given the way i drove it nope it cant hold a candle to what i drive now or several other cars    think of it this way if you eat quality steaks and seafood daily then a stop at subaru seems quaint but not worth enduring on a day to day basis,blueguydotcom
1247,January 2006,our us spec volkswagens get the watered down rasied suspension to meet federal bumper height requirements and possibly soften up the ride for american tastes the general publicnot most nuts like us who post here    was the volkswagen better than the gli  2001 prelude type sh 2015 infiniti q40 awd 2017 honda honda touring awd,nyccarguy
1248,January 2006,yeah a bit tighter than the gli its a really tall vehicle for something thats not very big like you slide across into a seat rather than dropping down into one odd almost suvish still i think i may be too hard on cars v others so you might see the volkswagen as an utter blast shrug    of the volkswagen platform cars i liked the audi the most still i feel my my affection for aduivolkswagen will have to stop at the dsg20 i dont think i can ever go back to fwd even something as mundane as a freeway ondodgep is a source of great fun in a rwd car basically after driving only my 3 daily for 6 months not including rentals for business trips i think ill never get another fwd car,blueguydotcom
1249,January 2006,basically after driving only my 3 daily for 6 months not including rentals for business trips i think ill never get another fwd car     heartily agree,kdshapiro
1250,January 2006,if you are still looking look at the saab 93 20 t this thing is a blast to drive everything i have read say the reliablity is excellent on all the 05 and 06s and after reading tons of consumer reviews this is the car we like best great buy,05fordexplorer
1251,January 2006,if you are still looking look at the saab 93 20 t this thing is a blast to drive everything i have read say the reliablity is excellent on all the 05 and 06s and after reading tons of consumer reviews this is the car we like best great buy    not a very costefficient buy however the rapid depreciation on saabs is horrific if you plan on buying one also plan on keeping it a loooong time and driving it until it dies,bdr127
1252,January 2006,i came really close to buying an 05 330i i like the old style 3series over the new but for just everyday driving to work  back 7 miles down 1 street i really would like more interior niceties than bmw offers in the 3series at that price range it seems to me that a car these days should have a cd changer and any sort of security system the pontiac5 coupe is my favorite on the exterior and i loved how it handled but the one i drove had a lot of wind noise that i think would drive me crazy after a while i wonder if it was just that 1 car  maybe i should go back  try again    right now its between the acura  lexus tl is longer than i want fortunately i want to buy in the spring or summer or even fall so hopefully the price on the is will come down a bit i feel like i should go with the acura because of its value but it doesnt excite me the way the is did i tend to keep my cars a solid 10 years or so  i dont want to buy one and later feel any buyers remorse,sosk
1253,January 2006,forgo the cds all together get an ipod copy your songs as 256 kbps mp3s sto it boomno more cd clutter no more searching for songs and now you have everything available in one hyundai    btw when the blazes are the entry lux class cars going to get indashflashdodgeequipped music drives the lexus lexus is finally getting one but why is this simple tech taking so long to trickle down of the buying market who would use it the lexus lss target group doesnt seem as tech savvy as the entry lux class buyers,blueguydotcom
1254,January 2006,does the rapid depreciation make it a better car to lease    or does that make it worse,calidave
1255,January 2006,if the residuals reflect real life it will make it worse    if the leasing company sets the residuals unrealistically high then it will make it better lower payment    saab tends to do the latter making their cars relatively cheap to lease relative to their msrps    regards  kyfdx  hostprices paid forums  moderator    prices paid lease questions suvs,kyfdx
1256,January 2006,i really would like more interior niceties than bmw offers in the 3series at that price range it seems to me that a car these days should have a cd changer and any sort of security system    a cd changer can be had for the bmw fairly inexpensively that being said why mess with a changer at all for my money ill get an ipod and plug it into the aux port    regarding the comment about the security system you do know that all recent bmw since 1999 at the very least have been equipped with a very sophisticated and comprehensive antitheftsecurity system dont you true the e90 lacks an audible alarm but who really cares about that it146s simply a device that simply pisses everybody off anywhere within earshot and doesnt deter a thief one bit that being said for the very reasonable price of 23205 from pacificbmwcom a fully acurated and easily installable alarm can be purchased    personally ive had one bmw with the standard setup and one with the full alarm package ill skip the alarm next time around    best regards  shipo,shipo
1257,January 2006,more and more car makers are supporting ipod acuration    they might as well be done with it and just put docks in the things,wco81
1258,January 2006,regarding the comment about the security system you do know that all recent bmw since 1999 at the very least have been equipped with a very sophisticated and comprehensive antitheftsecurity system dont you true the e90 lacks an audible alarm but who really cares about that it146s simply a device that simply pisses everybody off anywhere within earshot and doesnt deter a thief one bit that being said for the very reasonable price of 23205 from pacificbmwcom a fully acurated and easily installable alarm can be purchased    to build on what shipo said about the 3series    their antitheft includes an ignition imobilizer basically you cant start the car unless you have the little computer chip thats stored in the key    if someones breaking into your car to steal something inside of it then an audible alarm wont scare them off at all theyll just grab what they want cds money bags etc and run btw most people just ignore alarms going off in parking lots dont you p     if they really want to steal the car then bmw system is extremely effective in preventing that,bdr127
1259,January 2006,if they really want to steal the car then bmw system is extremely effective in preventing that    absolutely correct to help further illustrate this point back in 1999 when i moved from a 1995 volkswagen gchrysler to a much more expensive 1999 bmw my car insurance went down not that im complaining mind you i told my insurance agent but why    because our experience with bmw is that they are very hard to steal and as such we have very few payouts for that type of loss    thinking about this another way ive been active on the 3series and 5series discussions since mid1998 and in that entire time i can only remember one car that was reported to have been stolen apparently it was picked up and put on a flatbed or into a trailer and this was a car with the alarm system installed in the end if a professional thief wants your car heshe will get it and no alarmlojackonstar system will prevent its loss period full stop the end    best regards  shipo,shipo
1260,January 2006,if im remembering the same incident you are i believe the owner eventually decided that someone at the dealership had illegally gotten a key and either stole the vehicle himself or passed the key on the person who did not much a security system can do about that,pat
1261,March 2006,paragraphs are helpful things ive deleted the rest but that was the primary point    im looking forward to buying one of those small cheap in this case red compacts  a 325i you probably dont care but most of the rest of the world does quite nicely with smaller cars with smaller engines i guess you come from the size matters school of thought lets hear it for presence    another board has put forth the notion that any vehicle with less than 250 hp has no business claiming to be luxury in any shape manner or form others of us think differently    handling matters fuel mileage matters many things matter that american marketing tends to ignore you are entitled to your opinion but so are the rest of us,cdnpinhead
1262,March 2006,so i ended up going from an e46 330i zhp to an e90 330i if infiniti can button down the handling id be happy to jumop ship,blueguydotcom
1263,March 2006,as far as im concerned there are still no real competitors to the pontiac5 in a rwd infiniti sedan    just because you dont like the dimensions and rearend styling of the new 3series it doesnt mean that its not a real competitor to the pontiac5,bdr127
1264,March 2006,just because you dont like the dimensions and rearend styling of the new 3series it doesnt mean that its not a real competitor to the pontiac5    how about the fact that a premium pack 330i is 4500 more than a premium pack pontiac5  17 ford crew 27 67 coronet rt 14 towncountry limited 09 lsubaru hse 44car history and counting,qbrozen
1265,March 2006,sorry i thought my post was clear that i was chevroleting my opinion of my choices with my money for my money it is the right size and offers what i want and the others dont and again it is my money i am spending it is like ones opinion whether he likes spinach or the color purple its not arguable but it may certainly be discussed if you all want posts with facts than why bother  just go to a car magazine manufacturers specs etc i thought these boards were about opinions and impressions posts constantly regurgitating the same facts would be boring indeedie the infinit has 298 hp the lexus has 306 hp  i was actually looking forward to checking out the new 3series and i was chevroleting my dissapointment and i thought i was being respectful and conveying my thoughts about my decision process as other posters are talking about theirs i was and am really somewhat upset that i find no other alternatives attractive at this time i did not say that there were no alternatives for others only that there are none for me at this time who wants a infiniti sedan not a coupe in the right size for me not too big not too small etc if price were no object and a coupe was desired my first choice would be an bmw and that is just the right size for that type of car if you dont want to hear others comparisonsopinions than whats the point of discussing them i dont think i criticized anyone elses opinion and did not expect to get flamed for apparently having the wrong opinion i have been very happy with my choice of a pontiac5 and would not want it to be smaller or bigger but i do need to decide on a replacement for it,robertr
1266,March 2006,not owning any of these cars i did own a bmw 1600 for 10 years from 1970 to 1980 i have no particular bias one way or the other as such i interpreted your first post as simply your opinion why the pontiac5 fits your needs best    unfortunately some people dont like it when their opinion of which is the best car isnt shared by everyone thats why all these edmunds forums continue to rehash the same discussions over and over and probably few if any opinions have been changed,lmacmil
1267,March 2006,how about the fact that a premium pack 330i is 4500 more than a premium pack pontiac5    qbrozen that might be your reasoning but the original poster robertr never gave that as a reason i highly suggest reading through his post,bdr127
1268,March 2006,i posted this over in the bmw 3series 2006 forum but i thought it is applicable here as well    good safety review for bmw and its new 3series    httpwwwiihsorgratingsratingsbyseriesaspxid458,bdr127
1269,March 2006,i agree its really about the price more for the bmw less for the subaru it seems that over four years the pontiac5 sedan is evolving into the coupe with headroom its also lighter and cheaper evenso it has gained weight 3369 to 3449 and relatively more in the front 5248 to 5347 does anyone know the specific technical differences one more thing but i digress are suzuki guards really really worth interrupting those clean lines,carhastobefun
1270,March 2006,wow do i envy you    i wish i could decide whether or not a car was worthy of my hardearned money based simply on seeing one in a lot sure would save me a lot of time  then again i like test driving new cars i usually have to test drive them before i can dismiss them except when they dont over a manual then its a slamdunk    ps for the record i think the new 3 is too big bring back the e30,potemkin
1271,March 2006,since you quoted him i didnt think it necessary if the quote you pulled wasnt representative of your argument  well lets just say you might want to be more careful and direct in the future to avoid conford no harm done  17 ford crew 27 67 coronet rt 14 towncountry limited 09 lsubaru hse 44car history and counting,qbrozen
1272,March 2006,i am trying to decide which one is the better value i need a car that will handle well on bad roads as i live in the upper midwest i know the audi audi will be less expensive but am concerned about reliability after reading many postings any thoughts would be appreciated,meade
1273,March 2006,assumption when you say i need a car that will handle well on bad roads as i live in the upper midwest what you are really saying is i need a car that can absorb rough roads and pot holes without destroying wheels and tires    i would think that either would be sufficient assuming of course that you dont opt for the sport package on the audi 20t which has the same rubber as does the audi 32 it all rests with the amount of distance between the rim and the tread consider the following    audi audi 32 tire 23545 subaru7  sidewall height 420  bmw 325i  xi tire 20555 subaru6  sidewall height 444  audi audi 20t tire 21555 subaru6  sidewall height 466    as you can see the nonsp version of the audi 20t has the greatest side wall height while the narrower tread of the 325i will allow it to cut through the snow better which one is the best if you want awd and a true sp then your only option is the audi    best regards  shipo,shipo
1274,March 2006,i am trying to decide which one is the better value i need a car that will handle well on bad roads as i live in the upper midwest i know the audi audi will be less expensive but am concerned about reliability after reading many postings any thoughts would be appreciated    audis are getting killed in reliability ratings lately are you committed to an entrylevel luxury sedan those w low profile tires  billed as great handling will almost certainly provide a rough ride in upper midwest roads ie pothole city maybe consider something along lines of acura acura if you want the luxury feel and the good ride quality,poodog13
1275,March 2006,maybe consider something along lines of acura acura if you want the luxury feel and the good ride quality    at the expense of any decent handling at all any 3series or audi even without the sport package will be able to run rings around an acura geez i cannot even in my weirdest dreams nightmares actually imagine cross shopping an acura with either of the two german sedans meade is looking at    thought 2 maybe meade is looking for a sedan that has a manual transmission that in and of itself would rule out an acura    best regards  shipo,shipo
1276,March 2006,i just traded my 4 year old 325xi in for a audi cabriolet that is audis 30 awd convertable i believe that i may trade my loyalty to audi for good i also have a bmw x3 the audi did go for 50k but it is a solid luxurious performance vehical a big reason for the trade is that i was tired of taking the bmw to the shop the 325xi had recently developed rattles in the back seat that prevented me from driving it or being a passenger i love the audi many things seem smarter in the cabriolet the transmission is a fancy multitronic breed and is very nice many of the techno features seem better the luxury inside is more plush in the audi have yet to see how it is in four years however many reviews out there point at this model as being a solid value,mradel
1277,March 2006,i just traded my 4 year old 325xi in for a audi cabriolet a big reason for the trade is that i was tired of taking the bmw to the shop    umm youre tired of taking your bmw to the shop so you bought an audi yikes,bdr127
1278,March 2006,so taking an audi to the shop isnt as tiresome,potemkin
1279,March 2006,so taking an audi to the shop isnt as tiresome    my point was that audi tends to have a worse reliabilityservice record than bmw it certainly isnt an upgrade which is what the original poster was implying,bdr127
1280,March 2006,bdr    m bad i pressed the wrong reply button sorry,potemkin
1281,March 2006,heres another piece of anecdotal evidence a work colleague of mine bought one of these after less than a year she either sold it or got them to take it back on a lemon law case due to the amount of time it spent in the shop hope your luck is better,lmacmil
1282,March 2006,i just purchased an audi and didnt look into the reliability of it prior to leasing but i had a 2004 325i it was in the shop a lot all because of computer problems i almost think they over enginer some of those cars with too many gadgets the computer system would malfunction every couple weeks and i would have to take it in finally they took the car back and i ended up getting an x5 never had any problems with the x5 and havent had any yet with the audi which i love by the way,jmaire
1283,March 2006,maybe the audi shop has different magazines,pgsmith
1284,March 2006,the only real contenders in this class are the bmw 3 series infiniti pontiac5 and leuxus is 250350    audi  for those who cannot afford an audi plus it is outdated  cclass  for those who cannot afford an eclass plus it is outdated  tl  nice car but it seems a little large for this segment  cts  no serious luxsport sedan fan would even consider this atrocity    buckle up and hold on because the new big three in this segment are going to be churning out some fantastic cars in the upcoming years    be looking forward to the new is500 v8 coupe and bmw twinturbo 3 series coupe,neko608
1285,March 2006,the audi and c class are only for people who cant afford the audieclass    you believe this yet dont believe the 3series and is are only for people who cant afford the 5seriesgs    ive always felt this line of reasoning and it pops up here at edmunds often lacks merit in general but applying this reasoning to audi and mb but not to bmw and lexus just seems ignorant to me,fedlawman
1286,March 2006,i think you need to learn about three little letters  i m and o    the tl seems too big    you obviously havent checked the dimensions of the pontiac5 lately  3500 and 112 wheelbase    no serious luxsport sedan fan would consider the cts    youve never driven it have you you may not care for it i dont either btw but it is a capable performer and satisfying to drive    big 3 huh imo there are at least 9 players in this segment and subaru and mazda are knocking on the door and stealing sales all of these companies have exciting cars on the horizon,fedlawman
1287,March 2006,audi  for those who cannot afford an audi plus it is outdated    hmmm it seems to me that the audi in audi guise wins plenty of races over the 3series and others in the european car formulas how is it not a contender    best regards  shipo    edit    ohhh i see fedlawman took the bit in his mouth as well ,shipo
1288,March 2006,the 3 series is currently the most sought after sport sedan bmw designs it for people that are looking for a 3 series experience mb designs the cclass for people that want a mercedes benz but cannot afford an eclass price tag    the lexus es is built more for people that cannot afford their higher models    mb and audi must feel this way too since they put very little effort into their designs    i drove a cts at gm event in fall 2004its plain garbage drove like an abdodges tank and had an outdated interior,neko608
1289,March 2006,suffice to say that the above list of comments are your opinion and not true facts well that may not be totally true they are indeed facts to you    the flip side is that i will take issue with your assertion that the is is a true contender geez that car is simply a poseur car especially with the automatic only lexus yeesh    so are my opinionsfactoids any more accurate than yours i doubt it blush    best regards  shipo,shipo
1290,March 2006,come on man it is certainly not a poseur car its very fast and handles well great engine and is based on a brand new platform    when i see a cclass and an audi i just see that their respective companies simply have these cars available for people that like their brands but dont want to pay a huge price tag what did audi do with their redesign gave it all red tail lights and a beard    take a look at the audilgorgeous why didnt as much thought go into improving the audi    conversely when bmw made the e90 3 series they knew that it was immensely important to their brand and they made huge improvements to it to respond to what 3 series customers were looking for more modern styling more power more chryslerury and its selling very well,neko608
1291,May 2006,i dont think it has anything to do with the make but its all about the dealership i went to motorwerks bmw and woodfield lexus both in chicago area and they were all great,neko608
1292,May 2006,i was searching for a sedan in 3035k price range recently and got to test drive lexus the dealer talked me into trying automatic i was very surprised they dont have manual with this engine after getting into it i saw nice padshifters and was prepared for a good impression but after a minute a realized that you cant control current gear of your car  you only limit your maximum gear you dont even know the gear thats currently on  my current automatic subaru subaru165hp is more sportier in that aspect it always shows the actual gear thats on i cant say anything about handling  i simply hadnt got that far with a test drive its a luxury but not anywhere near sport regardless of numbers someone at lexus should be fired for that type of design,v_lad
1293,May 2006,just ought of curiousity have you ever test driven the is 350 before because the paddle shifters in sport mode on this car is butter smooth    and molasses slow try a double downshift at 65 with the tranny in 6th that move  id really go triple most of the time  takes 5 seconds in the lexus it was excrutiating i wanted powerthe computer didnt want to give it to me    the car has excellent steering feel    if you like numb then yes its excellent if you want to feel the road through the wheel the lexus is too isolated    i guess i am just curious how 910 reviewers can say the is wins in 95 of objective measures and then say the bmw handlesfeelsbrakes better and declare them a winner    because they like to drive i find the e90s exterior bland doesnt matteri dont buy for how it looks on the outside the interiors okay  but its not driver centric enough the place where the e90 shines against the current competition  balance handling driverfeedback driving theres no other sport sedan that feels the same right now or better bummer at 140 on the autobahn my e90 feels buttoned down and lets me know everything going on that makes the car worth owning    drive the lexus hard and it becomes really clear its not a sport sedan its a luxury chrysler with a big engine    the 07 pontiac5 may finally be some competition for the 330i of course the 07 bmw with 300 hp and 300 ftlbs of torque from 14005000rpm will be hard to be in any fashion,blueguydotcom
1294,May 2006,its a subjective feel control and driving enjoyment    from your posts i can see you are a descriminating enthusiast who wants a sports car experience wrapped in a luxury sedan body    take another look at the sedans in this entrylux class  they weigh 3500 lbs and have so much activepassive safety equipment that they practically drive themselves    in my opinion the car you are looking for doesnt exist,fedlawman
1295,May 2006,what do you all think of the cadillac cts,corvettefan427
1296,May 2006,having never driven one because of the following imho    credit to caddy for beginning to defineredefine itself with the cts however the overdone unattractive exterior and cheap looking disjointed in design interior along with the window sticker sent me quickly on my way the first time i encountered the cts now i may be missing a great ride but i truly enjoy a nicely styled exterior and an interior that suits me is a must while the interior does not have to be of the ultimate in materials i do want a logical and attractive layout as a reference audi and lexus do interiors right in my book as of course that is where i spend my time driving the cts which may have been upgraded since last i looked i found quite lacking especially given the asking price but i find all cadillac models a bit aggressive in their prices hence rebates and employee pricing    i chose the acura tl as fwd is not a four letter word to me i grew up with fwd saab honda mitsu renault volkswagen and appreciate the snow country advantage new englnader  avid skier i believe that hondaacura produces the best handling fwds out there and i know some rwd afficionados would consider that statement an oxymoron which suits me just fine i may lose out to  rwd at 9 or 1010ths but that is really just not an issue to me in my comparison shopping the tl offered the best combo of style luxury sport economy power and value    maybe the next cts will be a more suitable candidate  13 jaguar xf possibly my favorite of all the cars ive owned but my 09 jag xk was a beauty as was my 05 acura tl 88 acura acura 84 mitsubishi mirage turbo  78 volkswagen scirocco my first and of course the 92 nissan nissan ser and 95 saab 900s i bought for the ex ok i like a lot of the cars in my life,laurasdada
1297,May 2006,the new cts should address the current models interior based on spy photos ive seen and a review i read from a journalist who saw the car and described the interior as outstanding as far as the exterior if you dont like caddys styling theme you probably still wont like the new one although i think now that the styling has been introduced it may be slightly more organic for 2008 although its hard to tell,corvettefan427
1298,May 2006,ive seen all of the spy shots and artistic renditions that have come out and so far at least the new cts is a nonstarter for me is it better than the original i suppose although that is kind of like asking who is better osama bin laden or saddam hussein    best regards  shipo,shipo
1299,May 2006,i am not sure that most people are on the same page here most people may have their own definition of what a sport sedan is and what sporty driving is working for the usaf in europe active duty and civilian duty i feel that i have a good idea of what sporty driving and what a sports sedan is have almost 23 years of driving experience in europe and 20 of them in germanyto me sporty driving isnt 060 spurts or 14 mile drag racesprobably most of these so called sport sedans are not even equipped with the proper tires for high speed sporty driving while most americans come over here for the first time with their so called sport sedans and wagens and think 80mph is fast when driving well over 100 mph is a daily and normal ocurance over hereyou dont see american ford gmhondatoyotaetc burning up the trackmany ruin there vehicles or even kill themselves trying to keep up and prove something against the real high speed and sport vehicles like mbbmwaudivolkswagen vagand of course porschei feel that most have been brain washed and are easily sold on bells and sirensdodads and smoke and mirror tricks that really dont do a thing for true performance and true longevity of a vehicle i dont give a damn if one car has a better dvdcd changer than the other car or has 20 cup holdersour american car industry needs to start building good solid dependable vehicles starting with high powered engines that dont spend most of its time at the garage or at the gas station because its such a gas hogoff base here in germany a gallon of gas cost 686they build powerfull engines over here that use very little gas and last and gives you years of satisfaction,davids5
1300,May 2006,sorry but after another test drive late yesterday i am even more convinced the lexus is not for me    in my opinion if lexus were serious about sport they would have a manaul 6speed or at least fast shifting smg blueguydotcom is right this is a painfully slow downshifting transmission for anyone who really prefers the control of picking their own gear at any time    but even with a manual transmission i still think the suspension and steering feedback are a couple of rungs down from bmw i hate to say it  because i dont like the car  but the pontiac5 was better in that regard    lastly reread your 15 second solution to overly interfering vdim porsche has a button bmw has a button this is not a solution from a comapnay that has any serious intention of backing up their sport marketing with the real thing    the lexus lexus is a nice car for someone other than me,redsoxgirl
1301,May 2006,to me sporty driving isnt 060 spurts or 14 mile drag races    i tend to agree with you for the most part but i dont think you can generalize americans as a whole historically europeans have placed a higher value on handling than straightline speed but things have changed today american cars today handle as well as they accelerate and todays european cars have placed an emphasis on 060 and 14 mile performance  why do you think that is    the roads here are different as are the laws because our society is different as a result driving is different here so while i agree overall that european cars tend to perform better than american cars let me play devils advocate here and consider some current american cars     although theyre not my cup of tea personally i could go to a dealer tomorrow and purchase a 2006 chevrolet or cadillac sts for less than 40000 are they as good as the european equivalent not likely but they are outstanding cars in their segment and cost 12 to 13 the price of a comparable european car    the chevrolet may not have the elegance and refinement of a porsche 911 but on a twisty road or racetrack theyre pretty comparable both are rewarding to drive and own in their own way  a personal choice    the cadillac vs mercedes benz is a similar comparison ive been driving an sclass mercedes benz for 2 years now company car and while it is a very substantial car and suprememly comfortable its not at all rewarding to drive from a performance perspective it floats over the road with light overboosted steering and rolls hard in corners i havent driven the cadillac but i cant imagine its significantly worse than the mb    so while i personlly prefer and own european cars i have an e30 bmw bmw and a volvo v70 i can understand why someone might enjoy the performance and personality of american cars for what they offer the driver  especially on our poorly maintained poorly designed american roads,fedlawman
1302,May 2006,from your posts i can see you are a descriminating enthusiast who wants a sports car experience wrapped in a luxury sedan body    in my opinion the car you are looking for doesnt exist    almost but not quite i realize that nothing i buy in sedan or coupe format is going to match the driving experience i now enjoy with a real sports car but im also not looking for the luxury side to be at the expense of the sport side    i have driven a friends previous generation bmw bmw sedan and it would fit my bill and it only has 240 horsepower 60 short of the lexus but the true overall performance given what im looking for is miles above the lexus he is considering selling it and even though ive never bought a used car he has been so meticulous about its care and maintenance im very tempted,redsoxgirl
1303,May 2006,this is somewhat offtopic discussing european vehicle superiority but nearly every manufacturer you mentioned has a horrible reliability record mb volkswagen and audi are notorious 20 years ago american cars had horrible reliability ratings most dont think that is the case now buick and cadillac surpass infiniti and acura in quality hondaing to jdp european cars and maybe chinese cars are now the ones known for lacking reliability what good is the great driving ability of the car if its always in the shop    back to the topic i love the exterior styling of the cts if you want an exterior that doesnt offend or provoke any emotion the infiniti pontiac5 sedan is for you the exterior of the new 3 series doesnt do it for me but it provokes emotion    unless one wants to spend a significant amount of moolah aftermarketing the interior of the cts or even the pontiac5 the current kings of the segment seem to be the lexus and the 3 series    imho value wise the cts pontiac5 and the tl are the leaders of the cars in this segment as they are midsize vehicles compared to the compacts that are the audi the 3 series the c class and the lexus is they are on the lower end of the price scale too as the cts and pontiac5 both dip into the high 20s    anyone know why the saab 93 and the jaguar xtype arent subjects for this forum,allargon
1304,May 2006,do they even make the 93 and x type anymore lol    as for your question about shop time v driving ill take absolute fun for a day and nothing for a week over decent fun all the time so my 03 330i may be in the shop more than my friends 03 pontiac5 but my 03 330i is more fun than his car  even he admits it my 06 330i isnt as involving as my 03 so maybe my view will change    but given the lackluster competition its tough to see how i could opt for milquetoast lexus audi over fun    maybe the 07 pontiac5  much better interior better engine supposedly bettersuspension  will be the competition the 3 series has lacked for over 20 years    then again my eyes are already on 08 for a bmw sedan with that turboyummy,blueguydotcom
1305,May 2006,with ya on the milktoast audi comment its one of the most fun cars ive driven to each his own but the time i spent in a 330 with sport and manual wasnt all that and a bag of chips the audi on the other hand was more complete imo i realize thats not neccisarily the popular opinion around here but i would take the audi over the bimmer,dhamilton
1306,May 2006,i have driven a friends previous generation bmw bmw sedan and it would fit my bill    believe it or not in the first draft of my last post i wrote that you should consider an e36 bmw and the subaru sti and mitsubishi evo i edited my post down to size and removed that remark    the e36 is the first 3series that moved upmarket and became luxurious but by modern standards its still lightweight and nimble    theyre not the best built car bmw ever produced a result of bmw costcutting attempts but they do possess a good blend of sports car dynamics and everyday comfort    good luck with whatever you decide,fedlawman
1307,May 2006,dhamilton any time you wanna visit a track or even a really curvy road im game the audis noseheavy and audis awd system binds too much for my liking yes a chipped 20 is a blast as far as engines go but the chassis not up to snuff for driving hard,blueguydotcom
1308,May 2006,i am going to have to agree with dhamilton here i owned an audi 18t before and have driven my brothers 06 325i numerous times audi is way superior in many facets the 3 series excluding the bmw in particular and bmw in general is vastly overated i think the media and hence the bmw owners ovesensationalize their experience with bmw and therefore this socalled driving experience is almost spoken into existence dont get me wrong i think bmw is one of the best luxurysports manafacturers but they are not head and shoulders better than audi and other respectables manufacturers that they aspire to compete with as a matter fact most polls of europeans perceptions of bmwaudi would actually put audi head and shoulders over bmw,primetime79
1309,May 2006,my brothers 06 325i numerous times audi is way superior in many facets the 3 series excluding the bmw in particular and bmw in general is vastly overated i think the media and hence the bmw owners ovesensationalize their experience with bmw and therefore this socalled driving experience is almost spoken into existence dont get me wrong i think bmw is one of the best luxurysports manafacturers but they are not head and shoulders better than audi and other respectables manufacturers that they aspire to compete with as a matter fact most polls of europeans perceptions of bmwaudi would actually put audi head and shoulders over bmw    all that writing and you never actually mentioned how the audi 18t is better to drivewhats better the front nose bias the fwd or binding awd the heaviness of the audi the lack of power the understeer the sloppy volkswagenaudi manual the numb steering,blueguydotcom
1310,May 2006,ill let you both know what i think about this in a few months i currently drive an audi 98 audi with 6 cyl and will soon take delivery of the 325i rwd the audi has been superb it has sufficient speed perhaps could use some more though it handles very nicely on curves  and also at 85 with unanticipated quick lane changes for safety reasons the interior is simply amazing unless you are stuck in the back i suspect and hope that the 325 will handle a bit sharper and be a bit quicker it better it has 8 years on the audi and much fatter tires it will be interesting to see where i end up on this debate perhaps if the stars are aligned ill end up thinking both are some of the best cars out there,moose123
1311,May 2006,did you get the sport package if you didnt you very well might be disappointed with the handling of your new 325i    best regards  shipo,shipo
1312,May 2006,ive only driven the 18 for about 20 minutes so i cant comment to much on it i have driven both the bmw 330 325 and both audi engines 20t 32 to me the clutch in the bmw is rubbery and feels a bit vague as to when its going to engagedisengage i do think that there was better road feedback with the steering wheel but the downside to that is a nervousness that while on the track might be ok but for daily driving is tiresome i think the seats in the audi were far superior  the thing is bimmers are set up to not understeer and with better weight distribution can carry more speeds in to corners thats great but i probably wont be there i used to want an s4 for a trackeveryday car still kinda do and had one on order but a family tragedy put that on hold for a while bmw are the hot thing right now and for good reason they got audi licked on the car to take to the track on the way home to me audi is the better car to live with on a daily basis besides somethingsomeone is always faster tell you what ill meet you at the track with my neighbors 04 supercharged cobra with numerous suspension and engine mods then you can meet me with your neighbors blah blah blah,dhamilton
1313,May 2006,im really interested in what people have to say about this sedan its not as luxuryous as other cars discussed here but im more interested about a review of perfomance part,v_lad
1314,May 2006,ill meet you at the track with my neighbors 04 supercharged cobra with numerous suspension and engine mods    different cars for different jobs you can take that supercharged cobra to the dirt track and rallye with a modded sti that will kick the cobras butt that same sti will demolish cars twice the price    there is always someonesomething faster,kdshapiro
1315,May 2006,i did but i thought about it alot because of the pain of getting winter tires how does it handle without it,moose123
1316,May 2006,my e46 didnt have the sport package and i thought it was okay however when i swapped cars for a day with an individual that had one with the sp i was stunned at the difference i ordered my e39 a couple of months later and made damn sure the sp option was checked off     as for the e90 ive not driven a nonsp car however i would imagine that the differences would be just as apparent fwiw i too need winter tires and fortunately i have a place to store the offseason set that and it doesnt bother me to have to swap them twice per year    keep us posted on how you like your car     best regards  shipo,shipo
1317,May 2006,it doesnt bother me to have to swap them twice per year    i couldnt agree more i cant fathom buying a bmw and not getting the sp ok if they plan on aftermarket bilsteins and eibachs i might forgive them     the performance sacrifices of allseason tires are not worth suffering for the convenience of not installing snow tires in the winter    i probably swap my 15 and 17 wheels back and forth at least a halfdozen times a year it requires a jack torque wrench and about 15 minutes of my time  whats the big deal,fedlawman
1318,May 2006,i probably swap my 15 and 17 wheels back and forth at least a halfdozen times a year    whoa do you put the winters on just for actual snow events and then take them back off when the roads are dry surprise,kominsky
1319,May 2006,i moved from a 98 audi 18t audi to a 04 nonsport325i so feel qualified to make a comparison the 325i imo is superior to the audi in most every way that counts to me except for driving in the snow on stock allseason tires its not nearly as much contrast as what blueguy says but we all know that he tends to be somewhat  shall we say  strong in his opinions    first off the difference in horsepower was very evident the 325i is no hotrod at a rated 185  but i think the audi was only rated at 150 and we all know that bmw horses tend to be larger than most the handling on the bimmer is definitely crisper and brought an actual wow out of me the first time i took it through some real esses i had never felt turnin like that before since id been driving fwd for many years and detroit rwd sleds before that    other than that the ride and road manners are very comparable and both are very quiet and comfortable out on the highways but the audi could definitely run out of steam in some passing situations on the twolaners the interior of the audi was very nice and it definitely had better climate control logic but now im so used to the 325s cockpitstyle dash that i was disappointed in the interior styling of the e90    as for styling i really think that the audi peaked out with the model that i owned and that the later revisions and new models have gotten steadily worse that latest grille is scary and reminds me too much of an edsel if any of you out there remember those days i also think that the 3series styling peaked out with the facelifted e46 just coincidentally the model that i happen to own but styling is always a matter of opinion    so i really dont think that drivers of either brand have cause to throw stones at the other especially when there are so many other brands more worthy of being thrown at,gordonwd
1320,May 2006,do you put the winters on just for actual snow events and then take them back off    nah i dont have snow tires    my 17 wheels have high performance street tires and my 15 wheels have rcomps for des,fedlawman
1321,June 2006,dont need a large car  just not a small one like the 330    i agree that most sedans arent small  but this is a performance sedans forum and performance sedans are small    i averaged the internal seating dimensions of the infinity pontiac5 acura tl lexus is mercedes benz cclass and cadillac cts and compared the results with the bmw 3series internal seating dimensions    avg fr headrbmw87 fr shoulder rbmw57  bmw fr headrbmw74 fr shoulder rbmw54    avg rr headrbmw72 rr shoulder rbmw48 rr leg rbmw28  bmw rr headrbmw71 rr shoulder rbmw51 rr leg rbmw46    so how is it that the 3series is too small yet the other cars in this discussion are ok,fedlawman
1322,June 2006,ummm im sort of surprised at the misinformation in that post of yours    regarding your downside the autobahns in germany have long been known as the number one safest limited access highways anywhere in the world period full stop the end even the statistics accrued here in the usa during the double nickel era were no match for the safety of the autobahns during the same period    as for body bags im afraid your facts are in error here too those roadways are constructed in such a way that the vast majority of high speed accidents see all involved simply walk away from the wreck    as for gs ummm i hate to tell you but at 140 youre experiencing the same g forces as if you were sitting in your easy chair watching the pga tour    best regards  shipo,shipo

1326,June 2006,far too small of a car for the price tag i love driving a great car but if i have to sacrifice being able to live a realworld life to squeeze into something that small just not worth it    wow im of the opinion the e46 and e90 are too large the e46 was a bit too big for my tastes the e90 is massive its the second biggest problem i have with my e90  the first being that the car is way too soft even with a sport package a salesman at my dealership said he loved the e90 because it felt so refined thats thr exact reason i find the e90 pretty darn boring compared to what i want from a car compared to the competition well its got zero peers right now,blueguydotcom
1327,June 2006,when was the last time you were in a car at 140 mph  i hope you dont commute anywhere near me     throughout april i drove my car in europe 140 isnt unusual on the autobahn autostrada french toll roads etc    btw ive cruised at over 130 on my way to vegas more than once short drive when you average over 100 mph same goes for the drive from la to sfsac on i5 nothing out there,blueguydotcom
1328,June 2006,especially when in the tl you dont maybe it has to do with the 10000 still left in your wallet choosing the tl over the 3    whats the best price one can get on a tl 31k edmunds says 32k for a tl with manual carsdirect offers 314k ill believe carsdirect good price but remember service isnt included well be nice and add only 1k for service over 4 years50k miles 324k good price my 06 330i was 33k more expensive not 10k    personally 3k is not enough to sway me toward fwd especially on a car as large as a tl to each his own but 10k is stretching credibilityby alot,blueguydotcom
1329,June 2006,a report shows the fatality rate on the western autobahn has been virtually identical to the death rates on us interstates for over ten years    hmmm a single report huh well you have to be very careful with your numbers true roadway fatalities between the usa and germany are nearly identical and have been for some time im currently looking at 2003 statistics and the usa actually has a very small edge in that we suffer roughly 94 fatalities per one billion kilometers driven versus 97 in germany that having been said those statistics are for all roads in the referenced country when you limit the statistics to just the motorway the usa suffers 52 fatalities per one billion kilometers while germany slides in at 38 a reduction of 27    over the years ive read lots of reports from lots of sources and the closest that ive ever heard from an antiautobahn group no less was about 20 fewer fatalities than the us per given distance so with all that said i must seriously question the veracity of the source you are quoting    ps you are experiencing 1g while standing still on the earths surface    no kidding just exactly like when your tooling along with the cruise control set at 140 or when youre in a 747 busting through the air at over 560 mph    speaking of autobahning with the cruise control set a couple of years back my wife and i were gliding along with the cc set at a buck thirty and the ddodgea was so intense not that my wife someone who doesnt like lots of speed had no idea how fast we were going when she found out she yawned and returned to her book     best regards  shipo,shipo
1330,June 2006,speaking of autobahning once i was travelling from abq to sd my gf was driving for awhile i was reading i glanced at the computer and noticed our fuel economy had dropped from 29 to 26 worried i asked her if the engine felt ok she told me to look at the speedometer and i noticed we were doing 120    i pointed out i wasnt the one who was going to deal with the chp in this situation and i went back to my book    another time i hit 137 in her saab she didnt notice either    the above shenannigans is less likely to get you killed that gabbing in your cell phone doing 55 on the highway or reaching back to smack your kids    dave,dhanley
1331,June 2006,statistics can be misleading banging your left knee into the door in the 3 is not misleading    the 3series may not fit you but the measurements are not subject to debate    maybe it has to do with the 10000 still left in your wallet choosing the tl over the 3    why stop there the toyota toyota costs 8000 less than the tl better yet for 4000 less than the toyota ive heard great things about the hyundai hyundai,fedlawman
1332,June 2006,why stop there the toyota toyota costs 8000 less than the tl better yet for 4000 less than the toyota ive heard great things about the hyundai hyundai    because those cars are not entry level luxury performance sedans p,ggesq
1333,June 2006,the above shenannigans is less likely to get you killed that gabbing in your cell phone doing 55 on the highway or reaching back to smack your kids     by no means am i saying that i follow the speed limit all the time but seriously i hope you or your girlfriend is no where near me or my family when you are driving in such a reckless manner personally i would take my chances with a guy on his cell vs someone driving that fast near me mad,ggesq
1334,June 2006,my 06 330i was 33k more expensive not 10k    wow  great price the dealer around here was about 10k more for a comparably equipped 330i vs the tl hell yea id take the 330 for mid 35s just wasnt gonna happen    maybe the european delivery option will become more feasible down the road but for now the tl offers a lot for the money fwd isnt that big a negative for me,goodegg
1335,June 2006,in some parts of california consumers are picking up new tls for around 29k check the forums if you wish more realistic numbers add in the cost of flying to europe to pick up your 330 and those related costs and you are probably over 3k  10k might be an misstatement 56k is more reasonable imo    but remember service isnt included  true but who wants their car in the shop every other month by the time the bmw gets out of warranty or the 50k free maintenance progdodge oh boy p,ggesq

1337,June 2006,in some parts of california consumers are picking up new tls for around 29k check the forums if you wish more realistic numbers    just checked edmunds with my zip in so cal  32k    add in the cost of flying to europe to pick up your 330 and those related costs and you are probably over 3k    noooo thats called a vacation if i didnt want to take a vacation to europe i could have flown in picked up the car and flown out the same day for less than 700 from so cal  much less from eastern states of course frequent flyer miles can make the whole flight free    true but who wants their car in the shop every other month by the time the bmw gets out of warranty or the 50k free maintenance progdodge oh boy    ill take in the shop once a month over fwd and a large size any day my last 3 series spent probably a month total in the shop i wouldnt have traded that for 5k in savings and a tl not a chance theres that much of a driving difference,blueguydotcom
1338,June 2006,personally i would take my chances with a guy on his cell vs someone driving that fast near me    the person doing 100 passes you in a flash if people in the usa obeyed the worldwide save for the uk and those jerks in switzerland view that the left lane is for faster traffic you wouldnt have to worry left lane campers ruin driving and endanger everybody if people would keep to the right wed all be safer unfortunately the cell phone people camp out in the left lane talk with their kids watch dvds and in general ignore everything going on behind them and in front of them too    arghnearing a rant regardless im far more afraid of people involved in something other than driving  drinking eating talking on the cell phone those people scare the blazes out of me,blueguydotcom
1339,June 2006,i hope you or your girlfriend is no where near me or my family when you are driving in such a reckless manner    i never said anything about driving in a reckless manner,dhanley
1340,June 2006,true but who wants their car in the shop every other month by the time the bmw gets out of warranty or the 50k free maintenance progdodge oh boy p    1 ive had two repair on my bmw at 115k miles    2 my overall repair cost is similar to friends who also track their expenses for their domesticjapanese cars bmw space the services out so they individually cost more but they cost per mile is not going to make the entrylux buyer go broke    dave,dhanley
1341,June 2006,the 50k miles of free service bmw gives you is a big advantage as are bmw spaced out service intervals i love cars as much as the next guy but taking them in for service is a pain your time is valuable    im lucky that my honda dealer gives out loaner cars i have the oil changed and tires rotated every 4000 miles on my prelude i do 20k miles per year about 5 visits to the service department per year    my dad whom i work for has an 04 x5 since february 2004 hes had his truck at the dealer for service 4 times oil change at 18000 miles inspection i at 35000 miles a brake caliper that locked up at 42000 miles and and inspection ii at 50000 miles    i know it isnt an apples to apples comparison but im sure acuras maintenance schedule is similar to my honda  2001 prelude type sh 2015 infiniti q40 awd 2017 honda honda touring awd,nyccarguy
1342,June 2006,that argument might make a little more sense in areas where all exits and entrances are to the right that is not the case in the northeast us particularly near cities where you wouldnt want to go 100 mph anyway    one of my closest calls ever happened when i tried to merge onto an chevroletway in connecticut the merger was from the left the speed limit was 50 mph and the idiot who almost slammed into me was doing at least 80 i had to go into the left shoulder to avoid getting nailed and then had to wait almost a minute for traffic to clear before getting back onto the highway    in my opinion speeding fines should be doubled if the speeder is in the left lane within a mile of such an interchange    blueguydotcom states that if people would keep to the right wed all be safer i agree but i also think wed all be safer if more people drove the speed limit,rwm741
1343,June 2006,ill take in the shop once a month over fwd and a large size any day my last 3 series spent probably a month total in the shop i wouldnt have traded that for 5k in savings and a tl not a chance theres that much of a driving difference     one would think the size would be an issue in this segment if we could opt for a smaller car w no back seat but a better driving experience we could likely pick the boxster the elise or a chevrolet    as far as driving 140 my 94 pontiac drove 105mph on the 5 in central california with no issues it performed equally well driving on hyundai through west texas,allargon
1344,June 2006,its so silly to nickel and dime the 3 series or is both are great cars get behind the wheel and get whatever you feel the best in,neko608
1345,June 2006,well you seem to be assuming that if one has brought their car to high speeds they are doing it irrespective of conditions    i drive to western wisconsin from chicago all the time traffic deer on the road inattentive drivers usually at night sometimes fog i keep to low speeds one time i observed 65 the whole way and drove very conservatively and i got 361 mpg high speed runs are for empty roads clear line of sight ideal conditions etc    i maintain that the above behavior is a lot safer than a soccer momdad yakking on their cell oblivious to whats happening around them    dave,dhanley
1346,June 2006,i agree with you that people should drive at the speed limit but i also think that the speed limit shouldnt be at 55 mph i dont know what you drive but my car is just not designed to go 55 mph in order to obey the speed limit ill have to concentrate so hard on my speedometer which causes distractions and further endanger myself and other drivers,louiswei
1347,June 2006,is the lincoln ls still considered a entrylevel luxury performance sedan,bigo08
1348,June 2006,wow talk about picking a random isolated bit of the driving experience im talking about open freeways not bits of road locked into city planning errors logically if one is driving an chevroletway that was designed in such a fashion and the speed limit is 50 isnt that just a road  50 mph is slower than most of the normal roadways upon which i grew up driving then yes someone doing 80 is outlandish    on the flipside the i15 corridor to vegas is desolate for over 150 miles its nothing but dirt and road same with 350 miles of i5 between valencia and sfsac    just 15 minutes ago i drove out of kansas city to the airport two to three lane freeway its 4305 am repeatedly i was forced to pass on the right because jerks in the left lane felt they didnt need to move to the right for faster moving traffic i was only doing 80 for gods sake  on freeways with speeds ranging from 65 to 70 these selfish drivers could clearly see me approach they couldnt have missed my slowing flashing of my high beams waiting flashing and eventual circumvention of their inconsiderate driving yes inconsiderate if one is in the fast lane a car is approaching from behind and its safe to move right then one as a considerate driver should move to the right post haste its that simple courteous concientious drivers do this the vast majority of drivers in the usa do not operate their vehicles in that manner they feel entitled to any lane they pick they merge in the same manner  speed limit is 65 and they get on the freeway at 55then complain everybody drives too fast    argh    cant wait to get home hopefully my e90 has arrived and i can have some fun in the hills this weekend,blueguydotcom
1349,June 2006,if one is in the fast lane a car is approaching from behind and its safe to move right then one as a considerate driver should move to the right post haste its that simple courteous concientious drivers do this the vast majority of drivers in the usa do not operate their vehicles in that manner they feel entitled to any lane they pick they merge in the same manner  speed limit is 65 and they get on the freeway at 55then complain everybody drives too fast    amen to that    on the nys thruway there are signs that are placed along the left shoulder that say keep right except to pass theyre there for a reason and its not a suggestion in ny its the law left lane leeches dont belong on the road period    unfortunately driving in the us is considered a right not a privilege and any idiot can get a license if they pass a very simple drivers test then feel its their right to stay in the left lane on a 65mph highway doing 60 with the cell phone glued to the ear and a double cheesburger in their other hand    wrong plain and simple    accidents on highways in most cases are not caused by excessive speed theyre caused by inattentive drivers worrying about their cell phone rubbernecking at the car stuck in the median putting on makeup brushing their teeth ive seen this more than once or reading the paper seen this countless times too and not concentrating on the sole purpose of getting behind the wheel in the first place to drive    but i digress,mz6greyghost
1350,June 2006,ill take in the shop once a month   my last 3 series spent probably a month total in the shop    exactly surprise    i wouldnt have traded that for 5k in savings and a tl not a chance theres that much of a driving difference    yes for you there is that much of a driving difference for others other things are padodgeount,ggesq
1351,July 2006,european delivery 15 off msrp  great lease rates    european delivery is a great deal but i dont think ed prices are anywhee near 15 off msrp as i recall from considering a 5 series a couple of years ago it was something like 8 off the base msrp all options were at full msrp i was able to negotiate further discounts but you could do that with a us delivery model as well,habitat1
1352,July 2006,sounds like your dealer wasnt as aggressive with ed pricing most folks are posting pretty good pricing discounts using the ed method theres some documents over at bimmerfestcom that show specific pricing details between us and european delivery,mikefm58
1353,July 2006,for this ongoing thread,pat
1354,July 2006,european delivery is a great deal but i dont think ed prices are anywhee near 15 off msrp    really you should tell that to all of us who do it    as i recall from considering a 5 series a couple of years ago it was something like 8 off the base msrp    youre working off the silly ed msrp on the bmw site you negotiate from bmw wholesale ed invoice price on a 330i thats 30975 add 7501500 for dealer profit most get 1000 over and 695 for shipping you pay this on any bmw bmw cca rebate  500 for a 3 series    all options were at full msrp    again not true depends on the dealer i paid invoice price on options    i was able to negotiate further discounts but you could do that with a us delivery model as well    if you can negotiate over 5k off msrp when there are not incentives on the car god bless    a 530is priced at 475k msrp ed invoice price should be around 415k with dealer profit a 550 is 585k msrp and 51k with dealer profit,blueguydotcom
1355,July 2006,if you can negotiate over 5k off msrp when there are not incentives on the car god bless    on a 550i 6speed i could have paid 1500 over invoice us or ed the difference between those is 78 not 15 why your dealer would discount the ed price but not the us price i dont know    bmw ed progdodge is one of the best in the business i am not disputing you on that but the price difference of 15 would only be the case for a buyer that is savvy enough to negotiate a discount to ed but so completely gullible as to pay us msrp    ps i negotiated a 10k discount on a 911 s cab when they were still in high demand and most were being sold at or near full msrp so i dont think there is a sigle bmw short of the bmw that i couldnt get at 1000 over us invoice with a little trying and the bmw isnt available through ed,habitat1
1356,July 2006,on a 550i 6speed i could have paid 1500 over invoice us or ed the difference between those is 78 not 15    the difference is 14 for a 550i httpbimmerfestcomforumsshowthreadphpt155946    ed invoice is 50055 msrp  58500 us invoice is over 54k    why your dealer would discount the ed price but not the us price i dont know    they would discount regular price but not to ed levels and that wouldnt help in the least with a lease people on ed and bimmer boards have 5 series leases for less than 500 a month once in awhile bmw will have two year leases with residuals in the mid 70s,blueguydotcom
1357,July 2006,its coming tonight at 11pm est    httpwwwcheersandgearscomforumsinsubaruphpshowtopic10409,cadman88
1358,July 2006,the difference is 14 for a 550i    you are either having severe math or comprehension problems i said i was offered 1500 over the respective us or ed invoice on a 550i by my dealer he didnt care which way i went the base prices not including destination or options would have been    us  54000  1500  55500  ed  50045  1500  51555    that 3945 difference is 711 of the base price in actuality it would have been less than 7 on a car ordered with a few thousand in options since they are identically priced either way    you dont need to use voodoo economics to promote bmw ed it is a good progdodge that can save a savvy buyer another 7  not including travel expenses on the lease side you also have to consider that you will be paying for at least a month that your car is on a boat or the port,habitat1
1359,July 2006,that 3945 difference is 711 of the base price in actuality it would have been less than 7 on a car ordered with a few thousand in options since they are identically priced either way    im talking off msrp why the blazes would i care if someone can get 1500 over us invoice on a car thats a lousy deal in the end that wouldnt help terribly much with a lease some but not alot im talking v msrp its a 1415 savings    on the lease side you also have to consider that you will be paying for at least a month that your car is on a boat or the port    you also get one month free from bmw add it up on a two year lease and its a ridiculous savings yes you pay a month without the car i assume that month is covered by the bmwcca rebate and then some if its a 5 series which gets a 1k rebate    more than the monetary savings you get a chance to do things with your car that a minute fraction have ever experienced how many people can say theyve motored along on the road legally at over 140 mph in their own car the car thats now sitting in the garage my god i may find my 330i zsp boring as all hell which gives you a hint at my distaste for the rest of this segment but i have the fondest memories of that car and roaring through the alps cruising through monaco blasting down the autostrada gliding along the french coast and of course streaking across germany    for me that will always be priceless when i think about my stupid low lease on my car and how people are paying 550 600 650 for a 330i it almost makes me like the car,blueguydotcom
1360,July 2006,ive bought three bmw over the years using ed including my last one  a 2003 bmw in whcih i got no discount    that said habitat is accurate with the economics the us msrp is irrelevent nobody pays that apples to apples ed is good for about a 7 discount on nonm cars,spiritinthesky
1361,July 2006,7 discount from invoice and there are plenty of people who buy at or near msrp ive seen people on some boards paying over msrp on the 335,blueguydotcom

1363,July 2006,i just bought the lexus is 250 nav premium 18 wheels for about 328k    i got it for a combination of things  style luxury sportingness and value it came down to the bmw and lexus a comparable bmw would be over 35 if i could find one equiped how i wanted need smaller engine for economy and nav since i drive a lot assuming the same type of deal the lexus was about 34k less the lexus just seemed like the best choice for me,jzalkin
1364,July 2006,bmw is definitely upping the ante it will be interesting to see how the car manfactures that compete with bmw respond bmw should be concerned that they price themselves out of their segment    httpwwwe90postcomforumsattachmentphpattachmentid33280d1153751708,primetime79
1365,July 2006,the bmw is still going to be a value car competing against the opposition base models  audi 20t lexus etc  it seems likely that it will lease for a similar price even if its sticker is somewhat more expensive    i wonder if in 06 the lineup will change to 325i330ibmw or if the 1series will take up the bottom rung its important to not make the people who bought 330s just a year ago rue their purchase or to leave bmw with a mass of offlease cars selling below their residuals    bmw seems to be working very hard at maintaining their position as a toptier premium manufacturer while still having an attainable entrylevel car it does seems like a difficult line to walk i think both the audi and xtype are failed attempts in this area as well as bmw own 318    dave,dhanley
1366,July 2006,i wonder if in 06 the lineup will change to 325i330ibmw    the 07 lineup is the 328 and 335 the 25 and 30 are dead pricing is already out for the 07 sedans and coupes    no 1 series in 07 wed be lucky to see it in 08    bmw seems to be working very hard at maintaining their position as a toptier premium manufacturer while still having an attainable entrylevel car it does seems like a difficult line to walk i think both the audi and xtype are failed attempts in this area as well as bmw own 318    agreed,blueguydotcom

1368,July 2006,any ideas on the fuel economy ratings    is the premium package priced higher    too bad they retained the bangle designs,wco81
1369,July 2006,i can see a lot of pissed 06 330i owners once bmw officially announce the bmw sedan well at least bmw can say hey blame lexus they started itp    cant wait the bmw vs lexus comparison,louiswei
1370,July 2006,any ideas on the fuel economy ratings    a first drive of the coupe in motortrend had it listed as  epa 2029 im pretty sure those are the same numbers as my 01 225hp 330 not too bad,kominsky
1371,July 2006,i can see a lot of pissed 06 330i owners once bmw officially announce the bmw sedan    why the bmw was a known factor over a year ago    well at least bmw can say hey blame lexus they started it    hmm dont see how the lexus doesnt compare to even a 325i let alone something like the bmw    cant wait the bmw vs lexus comparison    not much of a comparison the lexuss fast and thats it,blueguydotcom
1372,July 2006,why the bmw was a known factor over a year ago    no the bmw was not a known factor a year ago in fact the current 06 330i only came out a little over a year ago the bmw rumor didnt surface until around marchapril this year if my recollection is right    hmm dont see how the lexus doesnt compare to even a 325i let alone something like the bmw    exactly the lexus isnt comparable to the underpower 325i the lexus is a better candidate both on price and performance oh yeah by the way just in case you havent figure out why bmw decided to go with the bmw after only one year into the e90 cycle the 330i is underpowered comparing to the lexus and pontiac5 they need a product thats fast enough to make the 3 series a class benchmark again although i am not a fan of the current 3s design ill have to say that bmw did a great job with the bmw the twin turbo will give it the speed that it was lacking and with bmw superior handling no doubt the bmw will the undisputed leader of this segment again    not much of a comparison the lexuss fast and thats it    i see it as a very good comparison here are my predictions of the comparison    handling hands down bmw    acceleration draw with a slight advantage toward the lexus edmunds first drive clocked the bmw coupe at 56 sec from 060 however the sedan version no doubt will be heavier so 56 is probably the best that itll be able to do i predict the 060 time for the sedan will be around 57 58 sec    interiorluxurious hands down lexus    so again we are back at the same conclusion as earlier if you want handling get a bimmer if you want luxurious get the lexus    ps the 07 lexus will come with the vdim off button so itll be interesting to see how does the comparison play out due to this factor its not like one cant turn off the vdim before they just choose to ignore it,louiswei
1373,July 2006,bmw drawback no availability of either a sedan or touring version     a coupe provides lousy space efficinency with little gain in performancehandling if i want a space inefficient car i will stick with a nimble and light two seater instead,dewey
1374,July 2006,so again we are back at the same conclusion as earlier if you want handling get a bimmer if you want luxurious get the lexus    youre right a comparison is wasted not to mention that once the mags readcd get their hands on the car and apply their proprietary algorithms to determine true 060 well be all over the map again    although not in the same price range the upper end of the 3series sedans should put to rest any concern on bmw 3 series performance    at 40k neither of these cars are entry level,kdshapiro
1375,July 2006,bmw drawback no availability of either a sedan or touring version     uh i think its been confirmed that the bmw sedan will replace the current 330i sedan for the 07s my,louiswei
1376,July 2006,i think bmw will have a winner in bmw if they are able to manage not to raise the price too much say less than 1000 from the current 330i i am also sure that one will be able to find both the lexus and 330i at below 40k if choose not to get all those high tech toys still though you are right with any additional options these are easily 40k cars    as for cd i cant wait to see what kind of ridiculous 060 time theyll have for the bmw my first guess is 49 sec surprise,louiswei
1377,July 2006,the bmw rumor didnt surface until around marchapril this year if my recollection is right    your recollection is wrong back in june of 05 people were already talking about the turbo engine from bmw on bimmerfest the war had already broken out between the 35 people and the turbo people everybody knew a bigger 300 hp engine was on the way for 07    exactly the lexus isnt comparable to the underpower 325i the lexus is a better candidate both on price and performance    no the lexus is quite simply a joke all around sad its slow expensive cannot be ordered to specific specs without great trouble and has lousy handling the lexus is the same thus i wrote exactly what i intended the lexus cant even compare to a lowly e90 or e46 325i    they need a product thats fast enough to make the 3 series a class benchmark again    bmw has never been the fastest in their segment they dont sell cars based on 060 times    acceleration draw with a slight advantage toward the    again this isnt a bmw thing the 325i e90 on a track will devour the lexus all day long no need to be faster off the line if you can take a corner at a much higher rate of speed    interiorluxurious hands down lexus    i disagree the lexus interior is too soft and small its plush coddling and worst of all you cant see anything out of the rear windows and you cant order it to specs      so again we are back at the same conclusion as earlier if you want handling get a bimmer if you want luxurious get the lexus    i believe this area is the entry level performance sedansthus the lexus fails for many reasons some already mentioned    lack of manual  the automanual in the lexus is a piece of steaming dog vomit its extremely slow to react  like all automanuals try a double downshift at 65 mphthe automanual allows it after a several second delay    lack of ordering ability you cannot order an lexus as you desire talk to a lexus dealership want it with xenons and thats it good luck you have to wait and wait and lexus may never build the car you want you simply cannot order the car as you want it    maintenance  the lexus will cost money to maintain over a 3 year lease not so the bmw    btw turning off the vdim wont change the loose handling vague roadfeel body rolls and ingeneral soft design of the buicklike lexus,blueguydotcom
1378,July 2006,everybody knew a bigger 300 hp engine was on the way for 07    we are talking about the regular joe not a bmw ethusiast like yourself    the lexus cant even compare to a lowly e90 or e46 325i    exactly the 325i is a joke imo overly priced and tremendously underpowered which makes it a excellent candidate to compare with the socalled joke lexus    i believe this area is the entry level performance sedansthus the lexus fails for many reasons    correction this segment is called entrylevel luxury performance sedans a segment leader must contain both the performance and luxury if this is simply entry peformance sedan segment then we can add cars like mazdaudi evo subaru into discussion    lack of manual    a manual maybe a priority for you but that may not be so important to the majority we gotta keep in mind that not everyone buys cars in this segment is an ethusiast many average joe like me just want a car thats fast enough and feel comfortable driving it we also dont want a manual since its very likely well be stuck in traffic everyday while going to work and getting home in fact for me the interior refinement is more important than a manual transmission    lack of ordering ability    my suggestion isgo to another dealer because when i bought my is my dealer allows special order youll just need to wait 34 months thats it xenon wasnt a standalone option for the 06 my and thats why you cant just get xenon by itself however lexus has put the xenon as a standalone option for their 07 models    maintenance  the lexus will cost money to maintain over a 3 year lease not so the bmw    agree with you here however if i am able to afford a 40k car the regular maintenance cost really isnt a priority or anywhere near it in my decision process    btw turning off the vdim wont change the loose handling vague roadfeel body rolls    have you try it before or have you read any review with lexus with vdim off before if not what do you have to back off your statement even if its an intelligent assumption read guess lets not jump to conclusion so fast without any concrete evidence behind it    buicklike lexus    thats in your opinion i assume,louiswei
1379,July 2006,that i see with the bmw is that its a pain in the butt to get a stick i know you can get one if you order it but like i said pain in the butt no im not wrong ever see a 330 manual on a bmw lot doesnt exist at least not in houston ive been on a list to test drive one for over 6 months now still waiting at least audi has manuals on the lot  it proves a point bmw makes arguably the most sporty sedan on the planet but most people that drive them seem to be poseurs that like automatics bmw keeps cars in inventory for their customer base not people that like sporty driving my experience is that they are mutually exclusive,dhamilton
1380,July 2006,the above post is no indication that i would by a lexus i would rather walk audi anyone,dhamilton
1381,August 2006,i think lexus is going to get a manual tranny sooner or later maybe during the midlife upgrade in 08 as for the backseat id agree with you it is too small however i think lexus purposely made the backseat of the is smaller so it wont hurt ess sales    one needs to realize that lexus currently has two entry level sedans in is and es unlike the other brands since they know the es will sell well no matter what as long as they put enough goodies in there thus they have the luxury to experiment with the is one thing that puzzles me i wonder whats lexus intended demography for the is,louiswei
1382,August 2006,one needs to realize that lexus currently has two entry level sedans in is and es    yes and no mostly no the es 350 starts at 33k msrp the is 250 starts at 31k msrp so for almost the same price you get one car with a 35 liter engine and one car with a 25 liter engine the lexus is significantly more expensive they are not the same cars furthering the thought the es 350 is a rebadged toyota most car manufacturers have some overlap with the price in their product lines as well    in reality the lexus is a top of the line toyota while the lexus is a bottom of the line is,kdshapiro
1383,August 2006,the lexus is significantly more expensive    not really    top of the line lexus 4477400  top of the line lexus 4113900    lexus has a higher msrp than the es but once you added all the goodies most ess do the es is priced higher than the lexus    from this we can see lexus strategy to have 2 entry level sedans in their lineup es will attract buyers whom have families and are looking for a comfortable and luxurious ride there are a lot of them out there in fact more than the so called enthusiasts is is aiming fori dont know semienthusiasts or so called poseur by some of you,louiswei
1384,August 2006,an lexus can run 44k yikes    m,merc1
1385,August 2006,the lexus is significantly more expensive    youre playing the option game the lexus is 5k more msrp starting at 36k than the 250 from what you post it is obvious that lexus lets you option out the lexus more heavily than the lexus    lexus  11k in options  lexus  5k in options    the lexus is 3k more expensive then lexus hondaing to lexus website    so that even furthers my contention the lexus is a top of the line toyota it is true lexus does have 3 models of cars and two platforms within 5k base price of one another but there is no mistaking the rear seat of an is with the rear seat of an es its like saying the minicooper and 325 are two entry level sedans within bmw lineup    thats about the difference between the es and is,kdshapiro
1386,August 2006,please read my post before replying some random stuff    hondaing to the lexus website a top of the line es is more expensive than the is all what i was trying to say is lexus has 2 entry level sedans aiming at different market demographic thats it why you think lexus let you option out the es more heavily because they are aiming at the customers whom are looking for more luxury    at least the es and is belong to the same segment entry lux the mini and your beloved bmw are not not even close    bmw entry lux  mini subcompact    but there is no mistaking the rear seat of an is with the rear seat of an es    didnt you read my previous post,louiswei
1387,August 2006,the reality for many of us is that we want a 4door rwd car with a manual transmission good handling good power and a back seat that isnt a joke for adults to ride in the back seat in the is is such a joke that my kids couldnt even fit    i agree that the is is not for you but i would argue that lexus and many other manufactures are willing to give up those sales lexus can do it  they choose not to it makes their cars better for some and worst for others clearly the is is not for people who carry 4 people often it is for people that prefer coupes but wantneed the benefit of a sedan i rarely have anyone in the back seat one every few months but it is nice to have it as extra storage the rear doors help with utilizing the space for many reasons think of it as a roomier execution of the mazda concept if one needs a full family car  then lexus offers the es and gs    i have had multiple people in my back seat as everyone wants a ride in the new car so the backseat is just fine for lunch trips etc i think people make too big a deal about the size unless they need a full size sedan a lot of single or married nosmall kids professionals that do not need a roomey back seat    why would lexus make the 350 have a manual retool and add the extra cost for maybe 5 more sales does that make economic sense time will tell if lexus has judged the market correctly if they have solid does not have to be industry best sales then they have targeted correctly early results are positive keep in mind car makers are in business to sell cars  not satisfy a minority of posters that is why the lexus automatic will be the best seller in the lineup i believe as stated in a previous post reinforced by edmunds article that manuals are a dying breed i had several through the years and have no desire to use a clutch ever again    the great thing is that there are a lot of good choices if manual and a large engine is your thing then you can have a great car lexus will not mourn loosing you i also believe dont have the statistics that automatics have a better resale since they are more desirable same as having leather    enjoy whatever car you choose,jzalkin
1388,August 2006,one of the many problems that i have with the is is that it was originally touted by lexus management as their answer to the 3series the is doesnt even come close on many levels    why retool well under the old adage of cover your competition lexus is the only maker of small luxsport sedans that doesnt offer a manual gearbox with their larger engine    as far as automatics having better resale than manuals well i suppose that depends upon the car my 2002 530i 5speed pp  sp was resold after lease end for a higher price and quicker than any of the comparable 530i automatics on my bmw dealers lot think about this i paid 43000 in 2002 and my dealer sold it for 36000 had it listed at 36999 in 2005 just two weeks after i turned it in    best regards  shipo,shipo
1389,August 2006,please read my post before replying some random stuff     did you even read what i wrote so i had a typo the rest of my post stands as is lexus is not the only manufacturer different models of car within a few thousand of one another    but there is no mistaking the rear seat of an is with the rear seat of an es    have you sat in the back of both,kdshapiro
1390,August 2006,but there is no mistaking the rear seat of an is with the rear seat of an es    dude you wrote thisnot me    of course there is no comparison between is and ess rear seat iss way smaller it is really pointless to keep going back and forth on the backseat issue it works for me and doesnt work for you tough at the end lexus still got my business and many more and thats the most important thing,louiswei
1391,August 2006,as found in edmunds somewhere between 75 and 80 percent of the ferrari f430s that come to america have the f1inspired electronically triggered and hydraulically actuated transmission installed    thats still a manual though therea giant difference between an smg system and an automatic the shift speeds in the f1 tranny can be measured in microseconds in the lexus a triple downshift takes multiple seconds    bmw is not making cars for you they are making it for the professional that likes the image and wants a bigger safer car with bells and whistles      bigger and safer size has nothing to do with safety,blueguydotcom
1392,August 2006,the is doesnt even come close on many levels    but it also exceeds the bmw on many other levels so what are we arguing here there is no best car out there the car you bought is the best car for you,louiswei
1393,August 2006,bigger and safer size has nothing to do with safety    thats the only thing you got out of that sentence    wow,louiswei
1394,August 2006,as far as automatics having better resale than manuals well i suppose that depends upon the car my 2002 530i 5speed pp  sp was resold after lease end for a higher price and quicker than any of the comparable 530i automatics on my bmw dealers lot think about this i paid 43000 in 2002 and my dealer sold it for 36000 had it listed at 36999 in 2005 just two weeks after i turned it in    ditto my 2003 manual 330i zhp the dealer was so excited to get their hands on that car and they flipped it right after some mild reconditioning cleaning up the scuffed rims used 3 series with manuals dont last long dealer lots,blueguydotcom
1395,August 2006,dude you wrote thisnot me    dudeyou said they were competing models how can they be competing if the back seat in one is not usable and the drivetrains are totally different    the acura and tl are then competing models,kdshapiro
1396,August 2006,you missed the point lexus management allegedly targeted the 3series when they redesigned the is unfortunately for them they were so wide of the mark that the car has become something of a joke in the entrylevel luxury performance sedans market why well it cannot be used as a sedan for all practical purposes and with it lacking a manual transmission its performance credentials are seriously in question as well    looking at this issue from another perspective i know that i and a number of other folks were looking forward to the genii is with great anticipation why because we were thinking that we were finally going to be offered a car that was a viable alternative to the 3series as an overall package the is doesnt measure up to the prerelease marketing hype from lexus management oh the disappointment    best regards  shipo,shipo
1397,August 2006,they are in the same segment via price range and do a search on entry level luxury sedans youll see both the is es and bmw but you wont see a mini did i create that segment by my imagination no who did i have no idea,louiswei
1398,August 2006,okay whats the criteria to be in the entrylevel luxury performance sedans segment lets see    entrylevel is is below 40k check  luxury made by lexus check  performance 300 hp sporty ride fine sportier than buick but still sporty rwd check  sedan 4door check does the definition of sedan involve backseat size last time i checkedno    because we were thinking that we were finally going to be offered a car that was a viable alternative to the 3series    exactly the is is an alternative to the bmw not a bmw clone with different sheetmetal and lexus badge lexus offers more luxury on the is and an awesome engine thats all it needs to convince me that the is is the right car for me did i buy a joke i really dont think so no stick just fine for a socalled poseur like me i guess the very important thing here is lexus didnt disappoint the general public they merely disappointed the socalled enthusiast like you like i posted before general public 92 enthusiast 8 by that i think lexus made a right business decision,louiswei
1399,August 2006,performance 300 hp sporty ride fine sportier than buick but still sporty rwd check    lost me there uncheck why cant properly use the power that the engine generates    sedan 4door check does the definition of sedan involve backseat size last time i checkedno    actually apparently the rear seat size does determine whether a car is a sedan there was a thread here a year or two back where some folks who were quite versed in automotive history quite convincingly claimed that there were many 2door cars that could be called sedans and many 4door cars that could be called coupes or 22s which is the proper usage in our language ill leave that argument to folks more studied than i that having been said i didnt claim that the is wasnt a sedan what i said was that it cannot effectively be used as a sedan different language and more accurate when my then eight year old and eleven year old couldnt fit in the back seat i quickly determined that the is is a sedan in name only so uncheck here too    did i say you bought a joke nope for your needswantsdesires the is apparently fills the bill what i said was that calling the is an entrylevel luxury performance sedans is considered something of a joke once again different language    as for the is being an alternative nope sorry an alternative needs to be able to perform the same functions and the is falls short given your criteria a 2door car would be a viable alternative for your needs but i wouldnt consider any 2door cars a true alternative to a true sedan    best regards  shipo,shipo
1400,August 2006,the 3 series is not an entry level luxury sedan it is an entry level sports sedan the key is sport in my world the 3 series does not compete against the toyota although some would view it as such,kdshapiro
1401,August 2006,whats the title of this thread again oh yeah its the entry level luxury performance sedan if the bmw is not one of them why in the world we are talking about it then i guess we are way too off topic    no bmw doesnt compare with toyota toyota is in the midsize sedan segment,louiswei
1402,August 2006,cant properly use the power that the engine generates    wow says whom you good god if you are such an expert why dont you get a job with cd rt or become the chief engineer of bmw in that case    in case you havent got your license yet let me teach ya in order to properly use the power that lexuss engine generates is to depress the gas padel once the car is moving forward or backward you are using the power of the engine    rear seat size does determine whether a car is a sedan    says whom you again case closed    from dictionarycom    sedan a closed automobile having two or four doors and a front and rear seat    sounds to me that the is fits the description    what i said was that calling the is an entrylevel luxury performance sedans is considered something of a joke    exactly says by you againdo i need to go on here    an alternative needs to be able to perform the same functions    from dictionarycom    alternative    1 the choice between two mutually exclusive possibilities  2 a situation presenting such a choice  3 either of these possibilities    so that was your definition again what a surprise,louiswei
1403,August 2006,apparently you dont read too well a few points   i never said that the is wasnt a sedan   i stated that there are some automotive historians that dispute the modern usage of the terms coupe and sedan   i said that the is cannot effectively be used as a sedan different language different meaning and far more accurate    regarding the is being something of a joke in the entrylevel luxury performance sedans hey dont shoot the messenger i didnt coin the term even if i happen to agree with it    regarding my usage of alternative your snippet from dictionarycom supports my usage item 2 says a situation presenting such a choice that assumes that both options will each meet the minimum criteria item 3 says either of these possibilities see the assumption from item 2    as the is cannot be used as a true sedan it is not an alternative to a 3series sedan any more than a mazda miata is an alternative    in case you havent got your license yet let me teach ya in order to properly use the power that lexuss engine generates is to depress the gas padel    pretty funny in many countries in europe that mentality will only qualify a driver a restricted license i however qualify for a full unrestricted license as i am very well versed in telling a car how and when i want the power transmitted to the wheels     like it or dont the is as it is currently offered to the driving public is only a half baked 3series competitor    best regards  shipo,shipo
1404,August 2006,i never said that the is wasnt a sedan    so it is a sedan thencase closed it probably cannot be effectively used as a sedan for your purpose but for my purpose it is a perfect fit again its the your preference vs mine    so if you didnt call is a joke in the entrylevel luxury performance sedans who did sources please dont tell me its blueguysdotcom if so that is just lame because we all know that his opinion weighs about as much as mine    as for the alternative it merely means providing the general public with more options thats it if you dont like it get another alternative looks to me that your minimum criteria for entrylevel luxury performance sedans is a bit off from the general publics not that its wrong its justoff    as the definition of a true sedanplease enlighten me what is it i want real definition not yours funny that we went from the definition of sedan to true sedan its kind of hard to shoot at a moving target ya know    we are living in america so the euro discussion is irrelevant however last time i checked you are honda to move to other countries sounds like a sloganairtran    like it or not the is is in the same market segment as the bmw and is doing quite well,louiswei
1405,August 2006,keep in mind that not nearly everyone lurking and participating lives in the us or even north america  not at all,pat
1406,August 2006,hmmm maybe its time for a poll    questions  1 is the lexus is large enough to be used as a sedan on a regular basis  2 does a small sedan qualify for the performance moniker if it only offers a manual transmission on its most anemic engine  3 based upon the prerelease lexus marketing hype along with the prerelease rhetoric from lexus management about the is being a true 3series competitor has the is lived up to its prerelease billing or is it something of a joke    best regards  shipo,shipo
1407,August 2006,ill start    1 no its too small  2 nope for a car in this class it needs to at least offer an optional manual  3 it falls well short of the mark joke    best regards  shipo,shipo
1408,August 2006,yeah pat but only na and japan get the lexus,louiswei
1409,August 2006,the toyota aka lexus does not belong in this discussion the bmw is fine,kdshapiro
1410,August 2006,funny game lets see    1 yes my is is not a people hauler so its truly large enough on the other hand if one haul people on regular basis why buy an entry level lux sedan confuse    2 yes dont see any direction relationship between performance and manual tranny    3 funny it all depends on whose expectation my answer isif one is expecting a bmw clone then yes its joke i guess youve got punkd by lexus however if one is looking for an alternative in the entrylevel luxury performance sedan market segment then the is is one of the best options out there    so apparently you werent the messanger its you whom call it a joke why cant you just admit it the first time also this segment is called entrylevel luxury performance sedan not lets all play bmw give lexus some credit for being itself for crying out loud,louiswei
1411,August 2006,model july june may  3series 8585 10561 10865  tl 6304 5541 5977  pontiac5 5219 4391 4775  is 4848 4461 4605  cclass 5285 4250 4329    whats up with bmw in july,louiswei
1412,August 2006,bmw on the horizon,tayl0rd
1413,August 2006,yeah i can see that but gs sale didnt drop with the totally redesigned g coming later this year,louiswei
1414,August 2006,the difference is the 3 is getting a huge power boost the g is just getting some new skin and guts with a small boost in power 3 series drivers are more interested in performance than looks in some cases i bet if it could be broken down its the 330is sales that dropped off while the 325is have remained steady 330i buyers are buying for performance while 325i buyers on average just want a bmw but cant fit the bill for one of the big boys 5 6 7,tayl0rd
1415,August 2006,also the lease numbers on the 3series are just average right now while some of the competitors have laid on big incentives i think the pontiac5 has 2500 of dealer cash    it wouldnt surprise me to see leasedealer cash incentives dodgep up next month on the 06 3series  moderator    prices paid lease questions suvs,kyfdx
1416,August 2006,i would imagine 2k under invoice will be well within reason by october on the 330i    the 07 bmw and bmw sedans are certainly causing people to shy away from the 325is and 330is,blueguydotcom
1417,August 2006,the 07 bmw and bmw sedans are certainly causing people to shy away from the 325is and 330is    got my eyes on those what upgrades do those models offer over the 06s tho and at what cost,ontop
1418,August 2006,bmw  300 hp300 tq thats a substantial jump over the anemic 330i    the bmw  235 hp which is a modest jump over the 325i price increase is supposed to be about 1400 for the 328 and over 2k for the bmw,blueguydotcom
1419,August 2006, thats a substantial jump over the anemic 330i    and that anemic 330i just beat the new pontiac5 in a mt comparo oct issue looks like the bmw will continue its leadership with ease if the 330i can beat its most feared asian competior    m,merc1
1420,August 2006,looks like the bmw will continue its leadership with ease if the 330i can beat its most feared asian competior    3 series will retain the title unless and until porsche decides to make 4 door cayman i suspect    it will be an interesting fierce battle for 2 among c350 lexus and pontiac5,mariner7
1421,August 2006,3 series will retain the title unless and until porsche decides to make 4 door cayman i suspect    yeah i know    how can one beat the 3 series with its must have factor,louiswei
1422,August 2006,and that anemic 330i just beat the new pontiac5 in a mt comparo oct issue looks like the bmw will continue its leadership with ease if the 330i can beat its most feared asian competior    as i havent driven the 07 pontiac5 i cant comment considering my 06 330i is better than an 06 pontiac5  but not by a great deal  i find it near impossible to believe the 07 isnt a bigger step forward for nissan cant wait to get my hands on one,blueguydotcom
1423,August 2006,as i havent driven the 07 pontiac5 i cant comment considering my 06 330i is better than an 06 pontiac5  but not by a great deal  i find it near impossible to believe the 07 isnt a bigger step forward for nissan    i think you may be underrating the e90 because of your preference for the former e46 im out of that market but from what my frinds and associates tell me the 3 series still has better driving dynamics than anything in its class the sins of the e90 notwithstanding,habitat1
1424,August 2006,my guess is that 4door cayman if its built will cost substantially more than the 3 series once you put some options to match the 3 series too    the 07 pontiac5 may be interesting but id have to see the redesign in person before passing judgement also would have to have some seat time in it  2018 acura tchrysler sh awd aspec,graphicguy
1425,August 2006,my guess is that 4door cayman if its built will cost substantially more than the 3 series once you put some options to match the 3 series too    without a doubt any porsche would be more expensive than a comparable bimmer just because its more exclusive and people are willing to pay even more for a porsche    theres a fair chance theres eventually a cayman sedan after porsche has a chance to work the kinks out of panamerica their 5 series competitor which doubtlessly will be the most expensive in its class,mariner7
1426,August 2006,interesting point marineri think porsche may very well be diluting their brand though the cayenne was the answer to a question nobody asked sales of that model have proven that wondering if the same would be true of any other 4door porsche    regardless of brand the value proposition has to be there for anyone to buy if any porsche regardless of model has nothing that the buyer wants whats the point i like porsches i like the 911 and the boxter past that there doesnt seem to be anything else that would get me in their showroom  2018 acura tchrysler sh awd aspec,graphicguy
1427,August 2006,dont hold your breath on a 4 door cayman to compete with the 3 series its based upon the boxster platform and the likelihood of either of those cars having 4 doors is about the same as me beating tiger in the masters next year    the cayenne was the answer to a question nobody asked sales of that model have proven that    actually sales of the cayenne have been quite good i dont see one of them in our future as i prefer to get my s from a real sports car and need more u in an suv but somebody must be buying them    on the topic of entry level luxury sedans i saw a pristine bmw 2002 tii the other day it had been awhile and i was amazed at how small the car looked i know blueguydotcom likes the smaller size and more intimite feel of previous 3 series but going back 35 years it looks like entrylevel also meant entry assistance required,habitat1
1428,August 2006,i wish mazda would build that kabura rwd small car nobody builds small rwd sedans  which is what i long to own with 2006 tech,blueguydotcom
1429,August 2006,blueguy you might be in luck rumor has that bmw might introduces the 1series to the us market the 130 looks like a sweet ride to me,louiswei
1430,August 2006,the 1 series hatch is big cdodgeped interior but big dimensions ive messed about with them in europe theyre really long really awkward if the spy pics of the 2 series coupe are on target that could be a dream come true    also i see a lot of 1 series cars up from mexico,blueguydotcom
1431,August 2006,blueguy since you have seen the 1 series in person is it bigger than e46 just curious arent they suppose to be smaller and slotted lower than bmw confuse,louiswei
1432,August 2006,the 130    length 166 inches  width 69 inches  height 56 in  weight 3200 lbs    the e46 330i  len 176  wid 68  height 55 zhp was even lower  weight 3285    wider taller and nearly as heavy as an e46 the 130 wasnt the tiny lithe car i want,blueguydotcom
1433,August 2006,im thinkin that id like to see something along the lines of a rwd mini cooper y tu    best regards  shipo,shipo
1434,August 2006,oh yeah yummy,blueguydotcom
1435,August 2006,especially now that the new minis will be turbocharged as opposed to superchargedvery yummy id love to see a rwd mini  2001 prelude type sh 2015 infiniti q40 awd 2017 honda honda touring awd,nyccarguy
1436,August 2006,cd review of the pontiac5 infiniti    060 52s  14 mile 139s at 103 mph    the highs    it hunkered down and dashed to 60 mph in 52s covering the 14 mile at 139s at 103 mph  more impressive still our pontiac5 tester went to the track with fewer than 250 miles on the odo thats like putting an olympic sprinter in the starting blocks in his street clothes whatll it do with a proper breakin we look forward to finding out    the power feeds through a sixspeed manual thats the personification of precise engagementit makes the 3 series manual seem rubbery    this honey can dance as fast as you can pedal without a misstep and without punishing its partner in the ride department  its a setup that delivers bimmeresque compliance and if the 3series still holds an edge in this area the distinctions have become paper thin    upgraded materials a superb new bose audio option an attractive and highly legible new instrument package nicely placed switches with an exceptionally positive operational feel and a sporty steering wheel with handstitched leather all lend an upscale feel that wasnt really part of the firstgeneration pontiac5    the lows    the grip of 087 g is not impressive by the standards of this class    the brake pedal felt a little long and a tad squishy    were not unanimously seduced by the aluminum interior trimto some at least the optional straightgrain rosewood veneer might be preferableand the front buckets arent quite in the bmw league in lateral support    counterpoint    robin warner  this new car is stunning  bmw superbly balanced 3series is still the benchmark dynamically but the new pontiac5 is much nicer to look at    mike dushane the interior is still comprised of too many illfitting plastic pieces on the highway theres a lot of noise and small pavement imprefections unsettle the ride    mark gillies the pontiac5 also brings up another comparison to wit why on earth would one buy a lexus lexus the lexus isnt appreciably quicker doesnt look as good and is a fairly anodyne driving experience whereas the pontiac5 is a very soulful machine the is has a more beautifully wrought interior than the pontiac5s much improved cabin but thats about its only advantage,jrock65
1437,August 2006,and the winner was the bmw the g was faster 060 in 54 vs 62 but mt said that the 3 series was just a better car especially driving dynamics since this was not even the new 335 it doesnt look like anyone is going to dethrone bmw in the elps for awhile but it will be interesting to see what cd and rt have to say,pearl
1438,August 2006,but it will be interesting to see what cd and rt have to say    pretty much the same thing    just a better car  must have factor    cant beat that,louiswei
1439,August 2006,the bmw sedan should all but negate the straight line performance edge the more powerful pontiac5 has enjoyed dont get me wrong i find the infiniti to be a superb effort to bring an entrylevel sport sedan to todays buyers not all of whom desire the investment in a bmw unlike the lexus someone my size can actually fit inside the infiniti without cursing every moment behind the wheel or while as a passenger in the back seat    you get what you pay for either way imo although i find the total package of the bmw to reflect the generations of constant improvement on the class benchmark infiniti should be proud to release a car that is more than worthy of consideration for your sport sedan dollar    i wonder if the next pontiac5 coupe will also improve on its predecessor,lovemyclk
1440,August 2006,question    if i did not like the way the honda drove over bump and small potholes and it was too hard for me will the acura be the same,crusherg
1441,September 2006,good post    does sound somewhat disappointing    which reminds me of the bmw test drive appointment i have not made yet i am in no rush since i am still waiting for the sedan    checked with my dealer and he says a bmw sedan will unlikely be introduced soon,dewey
1442,September 2006,the dodgemistu 3000gts tt v6 and even nissan 30 tts could not make federal standards and neither made much power low also those were 1824 mpg cars with 6 speed manuals never met a person who saw north of 20 mpgs from those engines    as for volkswagen quality yeah it sucks but so does bmw quality i have no choice as no japanese companies make a fun efficient powerful car mazda mazdapseed3 may but its now end of octoberstart of november,blueguydotcom
1443,September 2006,its not a bad car its just not a car that appeals to me ditto the bmw dont like the 2 door coupes at all the stigma the poor efficiency or the idea of owning a bmw outside warranty bad luck with bmw thus far    if a small sub 170 inch 30 mpg highway rwd sedanhatch were out id go for it no such beast exists right now,blueguydotcom
1444,September 2006,checked with my dealer and he says a bmw sedan will unlikely be introduced soon    you can preorder bmw sedans right now the pricing is available too whats your dealer trying to pull,blueguydotcom
1445,September 2006,my local guy says that the sedan will be available in november i have really wanted an s4 for so long but this seems like a less expensive alternative cant wait to drive it 2 weeks from now at the bmw event in houston,dhamilton
1446,September 2006,thanks for the news    fantastic news this is the best automotive news i heard in my lifetime    weeks ago i asked my dealer to call me when he gets news about a bmw sedan and he assured me that i will be the first to know  he must have forgotten me mad why am i always the last to knowive never read anything official yet about a bmw sedan    i will definitely be going for a bmw coupe test drive this week and hopefully it does go well a bmw sedan would be a wonderful addition to my family a 06 bmw 530xi touring and a 83 mb300d unfortunately my bargaining leverage will be limited if i preorder it oh well i guess i waited long enough ,dewey
1447,September 2006,kd those engines today built as is years ago could not be sold they wouldnt meet federal air pollution requirements    me you may be right but the techtrend has been that engines have gotten more powerful and cleaner i dont know if the evolutions engine is related but they get 286hp from a 2l turbo so again im not impressed by a 3l tt making 300hp and i agree that other manufacturers can do that too    kd for bmw to do the same thing it would cannabilize sales of the bmw or bmw    me then either bmw has 1 too many performance models    kd let the other manufacturers come up with an entry level lux turbo sedan at the same price point    me i believe saab and volvo have and currently do have many of these models i had a dodge spirit rt years ago with a 22l turbo yes it seemed fun and sounded neat producing 225hp good for the early 90s but it is not a replacement for displacement the market here in the us at least when gas is moderate is for larger displacement automatics that is what people prefer and the manufacturers thus build that trend will continue as shiftable automatics become more plentiful and traffic congestion increases annually    i did read where the hottest setup though is a small displacement engine with a superturbo on it now that might catch on at least in smaller vehicles,kernick
1448,September 2006,dewster go for the bmw wagon    ,designman
1449,September 2006,as for volkswagen quality yeah it sucks but so does bmw quality    its not a bad car its just not a car that appeals to me ditto the bmw dont like the 2 door coupes at all the stigma the poor efficiency or the idea of owning a bmw outside warranty bad luck with bmw thus far    sounds to me like you are having a severe case of delayed buyers remorse and perhaps just some crappy luck with your particular bmw but i would hardly classify bmw quality as it sucks and even with your bad luck i dont think you should jump out of the frying pan and into the fire with volkswagen not a couple not a few but every single person we know granted only 56 that has purchased a volkswagen in the past 34 years has wished they hadnt three touaregs and 23 volkswagens but what the heck do i know ive never owned a bmw or a volkswagen i bought a porsche holding my breath and thank goodness its been near perfect    if a small sub 170 inch 30 mpg highway rwd sedanhatch were out id go for it no such beast exists right now    you sound like you are pining for my old 1978 datsun b210gx under 2100 lbs rwd 40 mpg highway hatchback  4 seat flexibility oh and 060 in under 50 minutes surprise,habitat1
1450,September 2006,overall bmw does pretty well as far as reliability is concerned no they arent lexus or acura but they are better then mercedes benz cadillac lincoln audi and as good as infinity also maintance is rolled into the price premium    as far as the turbos go yes this is new technology just not on trucks go to nasioc and see how many sti owners would like a variable vane turbo rather then there vf39s it eliminates turbo lag bmw was not trying to beat all comers on horsepower they already did that with the last 32liter bmw as far as 6cyl are concerned they wanted better fule economy and a huge flat torque curve o and a subaru sti does not have 430lbft in stock form not even close my other ride is a 02subaru with stage 3 mods vf30 turbo and larger ic it has been fun and reliable but i have no gurentee it will be tomorrow the bmw with less hp is what i choose to drive most of the time its just more comfortable and i dont have to shift yes i am lazy it also handels as well next car will be the next bmw since i moved out of the great north east i dont need awd anymore    edit the only other manufacturer i know of to use variable vane turbos are acura and porsche,blue330xi
1451,September 2006,dewster go for the bmw wagon    lol    my wife already complains that our 530xi is too fast for her mind you she is still used to driving her older 83 mb300d,dewey
1452,September 2006,im pretty sure the reason that racing teams are moving to paddle type transmissions is because they offer faster gear changes teams are far less concerned with safety than they are with faster lap times ferraris michael schumacher is on record as wanting to return to a 3 pedal set up due to the extra control and involvement with car  if safety was the number 1 goal they wouldnt be going fast to begin with,dhamilton
1453,September 2006,the cts and the pontiac5 are recommended by consumer reports cadillac is in the top 3 of jd powers most dependable brand bmw may trump mercedes benz and audi the 330 is definitely a better drivers car than the cts however i wouldnt dream of calling it more reliable you could argue that the 330 is more prone to issues since it has more features than the cts blush,allargon
1454,September 2006,i dont know if the evolutions engine is related but they get 286hp from a 2l turbo    for the most part bmw design their torque curve to kick in at low rpms the engines are designed not be high strung the cars are a compromise between performance and usability the sti or evo are not compromises they are no luxury rally vehicles except for the m cars the engines are designed for most torque at low rpms not max torque at high rpms  so whether you are impressed or not is irrelevant they are not designed as highstrung engines    me then either bmw has 1 too many performance models     thats the job of the marketing in the same vein the toyota doesnt have more luxury items than the lexus    me i believe saab and volvo have and currently do have many of these models    where is the volvo a pig on the road in this classification entry level lux sports sedans or the fwd saab might as well throw the subaru in as well and every single car that has a turbo lets call em all entry level luxury sports sedans,kdshapiro
1455,September 2006,subaru sti does not have 430lbft in stock form    correct but the point was they can pull it out of the engine with no trouble whatsoever,kdshapiro
1456,September 2006,is there anybody here who knows whether the bmwbmw sedan will have the hydraulic steering that currently exists in the 3 series sedans or will it have the electrically assisted steering that exists in the 3 series coupe    more importantly does anybody have a weblink that can give me more riveting details about the bmw bmw sedan    thanks  dewey,dewey
1457,September 2006,are you talking about active steering i was not aware that the regular steering is different however i did notice a different feel to the regular steering in the bmw for one thing it seemed to have a more direct tighter steering ratio than any other bmw i have ever driven it steers like a sports car not a sedan and i found it very sensitive to road feedback observe this closely when you test drive it i look forward to what you have to say about it,designman
1458,September 2006,i test drove a manual coupe bmw with 18 inch wheels today    and the best way i can describe it is by spelling it out nirvana    in my case the twin turbo i drove was no throttlekiller it delivered great acceleration in every gear i tested shifting gears with a stick was the smoothest of smooth experiences    you are correct the steering was definitely superior to a 330i sedan that i had also tested todaythe car handled the few sharp bends and curves i took quite flawlessly    rear space was more than i had expected the interiors fit and finish quality seemed superior to the sedan    everything about this car seemed superior to the sedan especially the styling i love the styling so much that i just may get a coupe instead of the sedan the coupe looks a bit like the 1980s 6 series and definitely looks more expensive than the sedan unfortunately a sedan is more suitable to my family needs    so right now my decision to purchase the 335 is dependent on one unresolved matter chooing between the coupe or the sedan,dewey
1459,September 2006,how was the clutch any stiffer i hope so,designman
1460,September 2006,the clutch is somewhat stiffer than the one i have in my bmw530xi wagon the 330i i tested today was an automatic    but certainly not stiff enough to build up some extra leg muscle    the coupe looks far nicer than all the photos ive seen so far its a nonphotogenic beauty,dewey
1461,September 2006,the mitsubishi evo uses a very large turbo and to get the impressive acceleration numbers you have to keep the revs pretty high 3k5k it is a very fun car to drive especially on back roads with no traffic or police that said in real world day to day for the average driver the bmw is probably faster as the torque comes in very early 14001800 rpm and stays around past the normal shifting range in day to day driving 5k rpmi drove the bmw coupe this weekend but they only had automatics they did shift extremely smoothly and quickly though it was much better than i expected out of an automatic i do prefer the rear view of the coupe but i think i will wait on the bmw sedan personally because i prefer the overall styling of it more to reiterate the steering did feel tighter which isnt necessarily a bad thing    i emailed an associate of mine who works for bmw in germany and she said bmw sedans should become availible stateside beginning in otober and should be saturated in most markets by late november it has been availible there since midjune i believe if your dealer said it wasnt coming then they obviously just wanted to move units on the lot i wont say not to work with them but let them clearly know what you want and if they wont supply the service take your business elsewhere,texasmerq
1462,September 2006,the coupe is more agressive then i though it would be i wonder how much further they will go with the next bmw,blue330xi
1463,September 2006,kd the sti or evo are not compromises they are no luxury rally vehicles    me they may not be luxury cars but they have the typical power features of most cars plus they have the important performance feature of awd    kd except for the m cars the engines are designed for most torque at low rpms not max torque at high rpms    me you should talk facts not what youre perception is from httpwwwedmundscominsidelinedodrivescomparosarticleid109126pageid684    28 trust us youll like it the 20liter engine is smooth all the way up and basically theres never less than 250 lbft of torque from 2500 to 6000 rpm and this is from an engine 23 the displacement of the bmw    again i ask you where is the power if they followed the same formula as the evo we should be seeing 400 hp and ftlb if im paying 45k50k for a car why would someone only want 300hp  the evo x due next year will be 300 hp from a 2l with a 6spd paddleshifting automatic with awd the latest safety and power features and is expected to lose weight now that is progress,kernick
1464,September 2006,i dont think anyone is denying that the evo and subaru sti offer impressive performance especially considering the price but we are talking 2 completely different philosophies they are all performance cars but the difference is that the bmw is geared more toward performance and luxury the evo and subaru sti are street legal counterparts to their wrc heritage one could also get about the same performance numbers out of a ford ford gt for under 30k but again its not really in this class either you need different tools for different jobs    regarding power v displacement while its true that the evo has a 20l and the subaru sti has a 25l engine they use much larger turbos and a higher boost as well thats why there is more perceivable turbo lag in those applications thats not to say they are bad but the bmw engine still feels like its naturally aspirated for all intents and purposes thats why its getting so much press and rave reviews much like the volkswagen audi 20 fsi did,texasmerq
1465,September 2006,can you please get off this kick about the turbo    httpwwwautomobilemagcomfeaturesnews06092007bmwbmwdynorevised    the bmw is running over 330 hp330 tq okay when youre seeing 285 whp and 285 wtq the engine is underrated by a long shot    and the 25006k rpm of the 20 means youve got a long long lag time before the car gets moving the bmw 30tt makes full torque at 1400 rpm big difference    additionally the 2007 bmw e90 sedan starts at 38k so wheres this 45k nonsense coming from thats a 6 speed with xenon power everything roof etc demand leather thatll be 1400 youre still under 40k msrp even with sport package youre at 415k    the current evo is not in this class  stop discussing it here youre comparing apples to oranges an economy car with awd and a turbo engine doesnt generally appeal to the same crowd,blueguydotcom
1466,September 2006,well i know everyone is excited about the 335s but my first bimmer is now 3 months old and thought i would post since everyone else was helpful to me    i traded a 2000 clk430    after 3 months and 3800 miles no problem or dealer visits    the torque seems to be improving as i did the slow breakin    driving in manual is all the torque i can use in a big city    the car is almost too tight w the sport package and rft no real problem with the tires but may try nonrft next time    the digital stereo jams    the cruise control is cool one small hyundai to  one mph one hyundai to  5 mph    28 mpg tops on hwy you may get 30 on 55 on a flat road 17 in the city without pushing it much i think the fule computer is flawed as it jumps 3 to 4 at a time my clk was better    overall very happy for 41k jim,jjdow
1467,September 2006,me they may not be luxury cars but they have the typical power features of most cars plus they have the important performance feature of awd    as said previously they are no nonsense no luxury rally cars not in this segment at all where bmw infinitis and lexus have a balance of performance handling and most important some luxury features to say they have most modern conveniences is not the same as saying they are luxury vehicles in addition last i noted a number of cars in this segment have awd as well and those that dont have a plan on the drawing board for awd awd is not needed in a lot of country    me you should talk facts not what youre perception is from    that doesnt negate the facts the sti and evo are high strung engines requiring high rpms to extract maximum performance none of these luxury cars are geared or designed to be high strung yet are capable of being revved as blueguy noted the 335 starts up at 1400 rpm    again i ask you where is the power    think blueguy adequately answered the question    the bmw engine and the evo engine are designed for two different audiencesapplications taking the evo down the autobahn would be a vastly different although not superior experience to taking the 335 down the autobahn yet i wouldnt rally my bmw although some may track it different strokes for different folks,kdshapiro
1468,September 2006,i for one view awd as a detriment to performance efficiency and handling ill take rwd any day over awd leave the extra weight the lower gas mileage and the freaky underneutraloversteer in corners out of my cars please    why do porsche purists prefer the gt2 and gt3 over the standard 911 turbo hear much clamoring for awd out of the ferrari or elise crowds is there a big push for an awd dodge or bmw never heard someone say the zo6 is fun but with awd itd be the bees knees    awds great if your in wetsnowysloppy conditions but for some of us those conditions just dont occur,blueguydotcom
1469,September 2006,the problem is that its not your fathers mercedes benz anymore in his era no offense anyone mercedes benz was relativly better built in the mid to late 90s all the gadgets started impacting reliability along with there drive to gain a mass market luxery audiance in response to lexus,blue330xi
1470,September 2006,agree awd is not as fun now that im out of the snow i will go rwd it does help traction when flooring it in certain cars,blue330xi

1472,September 2006,okay cool,gowest1
1473,September 2006,gowest is the latest poster in a long line of people who have pointed out attributes of other cars over a bmw while also pointing out positives for bmw    it seems most non bmw owners in this forum can talk about attributes without deriding others it also seems that any opinion that does not believe a marketing campaign of the ultimate driving machine will be derided within a short period    here is hoping that this thread really becomes constructive    i drive over 25000 miles a year in south florida where a stick would be murder the lexus is better everyday and provides a lot of sportiness when needed the bmw would be better for the minority sporting moments but worse for everyday i use the nav unit several times a week so other items factor into the equation besides handling    ps  those that want to say i wont appreciate sportiness  i say otherwise i have owned a cobra 300zx rx7 audi audi among others,jzalkin
1474,September 2006,i drive over 25000 miles a year in south florida where a stick would be murder the lexus is better everyday and provides a lot of sportiness when needed    i agree with the third pedal comments flame suit on however my bmw has seen every friggin condition in the ne without snow tires while delivering flawless performance and zero headaches lexus and bmw sell different proportions of luxury and sport i wouldnt say the lexus is a better every day car because i can appreciate the crisp handling and utterly precise control over every inch of the road ventilated seats ml stereo who needs an ml stereo when listening to the sound of the smooth exhaust    for me that makes a better car which i measure other cars against lexus and bmw vanilla and chocolate you choose,kdshapiro
1475,September 2006,i dont think anyone debating here that is has a better navy and superbly placed coupholders when it comes to coup holders lexus is in the class but itself but why would anyone get an is if you can get the same coupeholders in es and es has more room the same navy and even more ventilated seats the answer is simple 147marketing148 lexus did an incredible marketing job with is they promised to beat 330 and even though they failed they were able to bring people who simply can not tell the difference between driving and being driven nothing wrong with that we all different    bottom line if you enjoy driving and fortunate enough to be able to tell the difference in road feel driving dynamics and handling there is no way you getting a lexus if luxury is more important why not get an es is is sporty but even less then fwd tl,pg48477
1476,September 2006,i beg to differ    rocky,rockylee
1477,September 2006,shipo i wont dispute myself liking the bmw bmw i however was under the impression it wasnt going to cost a arm and a leg to own at 53k i can get a little larger 3 series killer namned a cadillac ctsv the 2008 caddy cts with over 300 hp should give the bmw worrys the ctsv with 500600 hp will be much better than a bmw sedan or bmwbmw sedan i cant understand why bmw priced this car way above a 330i when they are basically the same car the only significant difference is a couple of small turbos i respect the bmw alot but id be damned to be a sucker or should i say a lolipop on purchasing one in the low 50s when a bmw would only cost me a few bucks more in another year    rocky    i wasnt trying to troll for a reaction it might seem that way but it wasnt my intention i was under the impression bmw was going to offer a performance value not a over hyped 330i sick,rockylee
1478,September 2006,ummm you say that you arent trolling and then you post a ridiculous price of 53000 for a bmw yeah right the bmw comes to our shores for a premium of less than 2000 over the price of the 330i like it or dont i just configured up a bmw with metallic paint sport package and premium package which is exactly as i would order it were i in the market today and the msrp was only 43920 of course i wouldnt pay that as i enjoyed my ed trip so much last time around there is no way id ever order another new bmw without picking it up in germany so my price for the above bmw would most likely be just a hair shy of 39000    either way you look at it the bmw is way cheaper than 53000    best regards  shipo,shipo
1479,September 2006,the ctsv with 500600 hp will be much better than a bmw sedan or bmwbmw sedan    is that a proclamation or a wish from reading these forums do you think horsepower is the be all and end all of a car i guess the answer is yes if you are the underdog,kdshapiro
1480,September 2006,shipo    you arent suggesting facts like the actual price of a bmw get in the way of rockys opinions are you    come on now how do you think hell be able to continue to troll if he cant make absurd inaccurate statements and insane opinions about the attributes and qualities of cars that he has never driven surprise    just for the fun of it i might drive up to a caddy dealer and ask them to test drive all of these bmw beaters that rocky is promoting but i better make sure i park my 911 or tl in a safe place with the doors locked    53000 maybe rocky moved to canada,habitat1
1481,September 2006,us nonenthusiasts or socall poseurs will just have to agree to disagree    however i have pointed this out before and ill do it again its rather interesting to me that the socall enthusiasts are so forded on the driving dynamics factor which they have completely ignored or chosen to other important criteria like driving comfort gadgets interior quality etc i understand that we are talking about performance sedans here but at the same time these are designed to be everyday drivers majority of the buyers choose them because they are fun to drive and practical enough to use to commute everyday to work or to school as a daily driver or a commuter shouldnt we at least take some other factors into consideration besides handling    on the other hand ill totally agree with the socall enthusiasts if we are talking about the performance sports cars like habitat1s 911s for the cars at that level people rarely use them as daily drivers although some do they are more like a weekend fun car so people can take it out for a spin or take it to the track itll be totally ridiculous if we are taking the ventilated seats and cupholders into the consideration if we are talking about the 911 here as matter of fact i think people whom buy an automatic 911 or even boxster and cayman are nuts however the last time i checked we are talking about the entrylevel luxury performance sedans here instead of very expensive ultra sports cars    i know this post is not going to change anybodys opinion and yes everyones entitled to have their own especially the hardcore enthusiasts like blueguydotcom however i hope people can understand through this post that handling and driving dynamics is not the only factor to many buyers to some of you maybe but you are definitely not the majority and to many others maybe the ventilated seats are equally as important as bmw awesome handling,louiswei
1482,September 2006,lexus did an incredible marketing job with is they promised to beat 330    th beat the 330 on what handling did lexus ever say that if they did please post the exact quote or attach the link if not then please stop this nonsense accusition like lexus lied lexus lie however to many of us whom choose the lexus over 330i we truly think that the is did beat the 330i in overall package for the record i think the bmw might be a better package but with a very hefty price tag    why not get an es    fwd soft suspension yes softerthanis suspension too expensive ugly styling too big    is is sporty but even less then fwd tl    well see how the is fair next time with the vdim off by the way blueguy please spare me with your vdim doesnt matter comment will ya p,louiswei
1483,September 2006,nice move take my statement completely out of the context in which it was written theres nothing like setting up a fake argument and then batting it down good job    i reread your orignianl post and probably did take your statement out of context  sorry but i stand by the point that i may have not appropriately communicated    it is a subjective decision for everyone here to chose the car that is right for them and the lexus lexus pontiac5 bmw tl and others are all legitimate choices each with their own attributes thats not in dispute as far as im concerned    but imo the attributes that make up what i would refer to as overall driving dynamics and performance have at least some significant element of objectiveness that fact that you would chose an is with an automatic or i would chose a fwd tl 6speed or someone else would switch from a bmw to a lexus means that we have made our own subjective choice on the attributes that are important to each of us it does not mean that the bmw is still not based upon my test drives the heads and shoulders leader in driving dynamics    so with all due respect to those who may forego rowing your own gears or as i did want a little more of a family sized sedan than the 3 series offered in 2004 thats our collective perogative but as far as driving dynamics goes i for one am not so insecure as to give full credit to the bmw bmw where is is due and if lexus or acura really wants to compete with bmw in that arena it isnt going to be with a slushbox only transmission choice and numb steering lexus or a fwd platform acura or an overweight awd platform audi or cupholders or ventilated seats or,habitat1
1484,September 2006,habitat1 i totally agree with you that one should give bmw credit when credit is dued i for one am completely impressed by the bmw itll be a harder decision for me if i choose to buy now instead of 6 months ago however i think i might come to the same decision ultimately because of bmw hefty price and its stillugly interior imo of course    however let me raise this one issue    since the bmw is the benchmark in this segment do everyone else thats lexus infiniti audi mb and acura need to play bmw game driving dynamics what if one day say the is or g or even tl surpass bmw overall sales number does it still make the bmw the benchmark of the segment i am not going to say that its going to happen but what if it does i really dont think its necessary for the competitors to become bmwcopycats in order to beat bmw ill actually give them more respect if they can beat bmw while keep their own identity,louiswei
1485,September 2006,i hear you a lot of this stems from the general comments that lexus is not gaining any ground on bmw in the sport sedan market i think they are i set out to buy a new car and truly thought i would get a 3series but after test driving and considering other factors amenities gas mileage cost reliability etc i chose the lexus so and this goes back to my first post on this board i am proof that at least for 1 person  which is hardly a representative sample  lexus did gain ground on bmw,gowest1
1486,September 2006,did lexus ever say that    they did and thats the rub with many of us while i dont have time to look it up right now if you look over in the is discussion here at edmunds youll find a post that includes a quote from a lexus executive from maybe thirteen or fourteen months back that says something like the new is will outperform the 3series in every category    a number of folks whove spent lots of time in the seat of a bmw saw that quote as extremely promising me included at the time i reasoned that even if i didnt end up with a new is some good competition certainly wasnt going to be a bad thing as more details on the new car worked their way into the public domain it became more and more apparent that the gen2 is wasnt going to be able to fulfill its promise once the car was released it proved to be a cruel joke for those of us who would love to at least have a true alternative to the venerable 3series    is the is a bad car no that having been said given its relatively mushy handling slushy transmission unavailability of a true manual for the lexus vague steering and cdodgeped rear quarters i found myself walking away wondering how the aforementioned executive could even remotely believe the is was superior to the 3series in all areas    best regards  shipo,shipo
1487,September 2006,if you look over in the is discussion here at edmunds youll find a post that includes a quote from a lexus executive from maybe thirteen or fourteen months back that says something like the new is will outperform the 3series in every category    just to make the record straight heres what exactly what the lexus gm bob carter said in edmunds live chat back in september 29 2005    msmis asks do you think you will beat bmw sales of the 3series    bob carter its not our goal to compare ourselves with any other manufacturer i am confident that we have a fantastic vehicle coming to market most luxury manufacturers address this segment through vehicles that offer a compromise on either performance or luxury lexus has taken a different approach we are addressing this segment by offering two completely different models the is models offer incredible performance with all the luxury you would expect in a lexus our es 330 emphasizes the comfort and refined feel which lexus is known for and comes in a sophisticated and stylish exterior    coopnet asks how does lexus feel the lexuslexus compares to the 325i330i    bob carter the is is a much better car    he said the is is a much better car he did not said and i quote from ship the new is will outperform the 3series in every category    heres the link bob carter live chat,louiswei
1488,September 2006,thats not the quote i was referring to by late september of last year we all knew that the is wasnt going to measure up the quote im referring to was from july or august of 2005    best regards  shipo,shipo
1489,September 2006,since the bmw is the benchmark in this segment do everyone else thats lexus infiniti audi mb and acura need to play bmw game driving dynamics    no they dont need to play bmw game but then they might want to tone down the sports sedan marketing theme as though they are going after the serious driving enthusiast    fwiw i am similarly critical of acura with the rl all this superhandling and 300 horsepower advertising showing the car winding through the bavarian alps well its not super handling compared to the 5series and as it turns out it didnt even have 300 hp and felt downright sluggish compared to my tl 6speed not to mention no manual transmission option it seems like acuras marketing folks wanted to have us believe the rl was a driving enthusiasts competitor to the 550i but they forgot to tell their engineering department to deliver on the goods    let me give you a positive example of a car that did deliver on the goods  the 33000 honda s2000 they with limited self promoting fanfare took on the best from bmw 40k z3 mercedes benz 45k slk and porsche 50k boxster and imo beat them as a result they didnt have to sing their own praises every major car magazine and hordes of serious driving enthusiasts did it for them      what if one day say the is or g or even tl surpass bmw overall sales number does it still make the bmw the benchmark of the segment i am not going to say that its going to happen but what if it does i really dont think its necessary for the competitors to become bmwcopycats in order to beat bmw ill actually give them more respect if they can beat bmw while keep their own identity    sorry but i think we have a serious disagreement on the definition of beat a honda honda selling 400000 cars a year doesnt mean it beats the bmw and the limited production honda s2000 selling only 5000 units a year didnt lose to the z3 or boxster toll brothers sells 10000 luxury homes a year but they dont beat frank lloyd wrights fallingwater or robie house in terms of architectural character    there is no doubt that there are a lot more semi non and sort of enthusiasts buying socalled sports sedans than there are serious driving enthusiasts and there are even more get me from a to b drivers perfectly happy with a toyota honda or egads a gm but imo if lexus acura audi or infiniti insist on calling their vehicles sports sedans they cannot claim any victory until over bmw until serious driving enthusiasts can drive one in a sports sedanish sort of way and get out thinking that it performs better if they want to call them entry level luxury sedans then perhaps they have changed the metric in their favor for me its as simple as that    ps and just to clarify my definition of performance is not one dimensional like 060 times it is the entire sporting driving experience which for a semienthusiast might allow for a paddle shifting slushbox not for me and i accept i am flirting with subjectivity now,habitat1
1490,September 2006,a honda honda selling 400000 cars a year doesnt mean it beats the bmw    horrible example you cant compare the honda to bmw since they are in different class also is s2000 the segment leader in general consensus i dont think so its just a really good cheaper alternative to the boxster and z4 just like the pontiac5 is to the bmw    i have no objection at all to crown the 3series the performance leader in the class even if one day it does lose the sales crown however in this segment its not all about performance to the auto mags maybe to me the reason i spend 35k to get a sedan in this segment is because i want a car thats wellbalanced between luxury and performance as well as being somewhat practical as an everyday driver and cars in this class deliver that some are more on performance g and bmw and some are more on luxury cclass for me i think the is strikes the perfect balance of the 2 and thats why now its my daily driver otherwise like you said if performance and fun to drive is all i want i will be probably better off to get a s2000 instead    habitat1 you are a very lucky man to have a 911s as your fun car but some of us actually many of us dont have that luxury so for me i need a car that can give me a little giddy up when needed but at the same time offers me comfort during my daily commute i think by now everybody knows that i am by no means an enthusiast probably not even a semi so sports sedan to me means rwd and better handling than a midsize sedan i can understand that the is did not live up to many enthusiasts expectation but it is no way a failure or crap like some here have stated,louiswei

1492,September 2006,httpwwwlexuscomaboutpressreleasespopups2005pr0323ahtml    heres the quote that excited and eventually let down auto enthusiasts    were taking dead aim at the top of the class with the new is said lexus marketing vice president mark templin we plan to offer a compelling range of models and options with classleading performance and luxury    i was giddy watching the online unveiling of the lexus in march of 05  the promise of 3 series performance with legendary lexus reliability had me nuts with anticipation i poured over every detail of the new lexus and believed the hype finally a company with the economic and engineering muscle to accomplish anything promised to dethrone the 3 series alas it didnt come to pass the lexus was more expensive than my 3 by a long shot and far less fun    ps you guys suck at the research thing p,blueguydotcom
1493,September 2006,ouch    that press release should quite some of the posters on this forum who believe that the is was not marketed to driving enthusiasts    imho the is series is a good blend of performance luxury reliability and comfort lexus really needs at this point to hone in on the performance aspect and surely it would well be on its way to dethroning the bmw,ggesq
1494,September 2006,i didnt see anywhere in the article has a quote like the new is will outperform the 3series in every category thats the exact quote hondaing to shipo anyway but so far i still cant find the source of that    i am not going to get into another discussion of whats performance for me performance is the combination of handling roadfeel smooth tranny acceleration and many others one thing for sure is the is did deliver on the acceleration part but maybe not so much of the other area however on the other hand the bmw at that time was seriously behind the acceleration game but leading on the other area maybe the 330i has a better overall package on performance which i think it does but its still fairly subjective    by the way the is has definitely delivered on the luxury part though,louiswei
1495,September 2006,that press release should quite some of the posters on this forum who believe that the is was not marketed to driving enthusiasts    nope i think is is marketed to the socall driving enthusiasts poseurs like me since so far the is is doing pretty good ill bet there is a decent size of poseur market out there somewhere    again thats the proof of lexus did their homework    if you cant beat somebody in his game you have 2 choices    1 join him  2 dont play his game    looks to me lexus choose the later,louiswei
1496,September 2006,i fully agree with you that a serious sports sedan  forded primarily upon driving performance  is not what everyone wants or needs in their daily driver as evidence you got an is and i got a tl im not trying to talk you out of being happy with your car just as i wouldnt want to defend my decision to get a tl    but it initially appeared to me  and apparantly others  that lexus marketed the lexus as a serious sports sedan to that extent it falls short of the bmw false expectations were created that does not detract from its luxury attributes and the fact that for some it represents a better personal choice    and on that note im going to conclude my dodgebling with a so what back to myself we are all i assume reasonably intelligent people who can set marketing pitches aside and make purchase decisions for ourselves the fact that lexus might have been a bit ambitious in marketing the sport orientation of the is is not the end of the world nor is acuras coining the term super handling for something that isnt hell when i bought my 2002 honda s2000 it was a substitute for the there is no substitute porsche boxster and a pretty damn good one at that    so take my comments with the assurance that i respect your decision to get a very nice car that has the balance of attributes that work for you if we all agreed on everything this would be a boring world although i wouldnt mind seeing a few more robie houses and a few less toll brothers houses in the future,habitat1
1497,September 2006,we are all i assume reasonably intelligent people who can set marketing pitches aside and make purchase decisions for ourselves    hear hear    i for one have never believed in any market campaign i guessed thats why i cant relate myself to many others whom actually believed it,louiswei
1498,September 2006,sorry one other point    if you cant beat somebody in his game you have 2 choices    1 join him  2 dont play his game    i do not think bmw is somehow invicible at their game ill argue vehemently that the s2000 was heads and shoulders a better roadster from a driving dynamics standpoint than the z3z4 ever wasis granted the three series has been their strong suit but even the 5 series evolution to a bigger bulkier heavier car with a less driver oriented cockpit and stupid idrive opened the door for competition i had hoped acura would make a rwd v8 rl with some of the same engineering creativity that went into the s2000 and give bmw a run for their money wishful thinking    but i hope that other manufacturers dont run for the hills rather than challenge bmw as the king of the sports sedans if nothing else it will make bmw work harder whcih is a good thing for consumers    ok im really done now,habitat1
1499,September 2006,i guessed thats why i cant relate myself to many others whom actually believed it    guess thats me the thing is i wanted to believe i could find bmw driving dynamics wrapped in a reliable lexus people would ask about my 03 zhp and id tell them it was a blast to drive but id never want to own it if possible id own a car that was super fun and reliable i cant find such a thing so im stuck leasing bmw    the lexus brand like the caddy one appeals to a certain group a group that places luxury above performance im not in that group itd make life a lot easier if i could put up with a dowdy bland car like a used lexus ls430 i could buy one now and just drive it for 67 years like a friend of mine but im not that sort of driver,blueguydotcom
1500,September 2006,i didnt see anywhere in the article has a quote like the new is will outperform the 3series in every category thats the exact quote hondaing to shipo anyway but so far i still cant find the source of that    you managed to quote me out of context what i said was    that says something like the new is will outperform the 3series in every category    keep in mind that i hadnt seen the quote from the lexus executive in question for over a year apparently a year and a half hence the fact that i qualified my statement with the something like part fwiw my interpretation of were taking dead aim at the top of the class with the new is we plan to offer a compelling range of models and options with classleading performance and luxury apparently was and still is very much in line with what i wrote earlier    i think it bears repeating that ive never said that the is was a bad car ive simply pointed out that it failed to measure up to the very benchmark the early rhetoric claimed it would exceed said another way good car just not good enough for my tastes    best regards  shipo,shipo
1501,October 2006,no driving travel plans to texas but if you make it to dc i can run you by the monuments with the top down    now that would be cool    and correction im certainly not rich by my peer standards one of my bschool classmates has made his way up to around 250 on the most recent forbes 400 list several others are in solid 8 and 9 figure territory by those standards im damn near penniless but its all relative and im still not too proud to admit that i changed my own oil on that nissan nissan at least 40 times    well you definetly arent a typical suit then    not to turn edmunds into cnbc but on the house front i agree that your generation has it a little tougher than mine but dont get discouraged when i bought in 1988 fixed mortgage rates were 14 i went with an adjustable that worked its way up to 1275 before interest rates started heading down and i was able to refinance all the pain you can bear now on the house front will likely pay dividends in the long run if you go for a quality location    lastly i respect the hard working folks that put their time in working for gm and i hope i never say anything that is contadictory to that i put the blame for the decline of the company mostly on management and some on the union heads and structure but not the union rank and file    wow that was a nice compliment i deep down do blame the uaw suits for some of the workrules they had in place for all those years thinkgod they are finally loosening them i guess they are making up to gm and ford by allowing them to hire temps really cheap whats weird is they didnt extend the offer to dcx tension between the mustache guy and getterfinger  who knows surprise    rocky,rockylee

1503,October 2006,what  the sport suspension package is 47k with precollision the sportsuspension is more than the luxurypackage you need to go do some research before criticizing me    i did    sports package w additional options 4346200    sport package includes   perforated leathertrimmed interior   power tiltandtelescopic steering column   lexus memory system for power drivers seat except lumbar outside mirrors and steering wheel   heated and ventilated front seats   aluminum sport pedals   aluminum doorsill scuff plates   rainsensing intermittent windshield wipers with mist cycle   electrochromic autodimming outside mirrors with auto tiltdown in reverse   bixenon highintensity discharge hid headlamps   adaptive front lighting system afs   sporttuned suspension   18inch alloy wheels    additional options   lexus voiceactivated dvd navigation system   intuitive parking assist   headlamp washers   preferred accessory package includes cargo net trunk mat and wheel locks        luxury package w additional options 4443600    luxury package with 18in wheels includes   auburn birdseye maple interior trim   perforated leathertrimmed interior   power tiltandtelescopic steering column   lexus memory system for power drivers seat except lumbar outside mirrors and steering wheel   heated and ventilated front seats   ilchevroletted doorsill scuff plates   power rearwindow sunshade   rainsensing intermittent windshield wipers with mist cycle   electrochromic autodimming outside mirrors with auto tiltdown in reverse   bixenon high intensity discharge hid headlamps   adaptive front lighting system afs   18in alloy wheels    additional options   lexus voiceactivated dvd navigation system   intuitive parking assist   headlamp washers   preferred accessory package includes cargo net trunk mat and wheel locks   rear spoiler   floor mats allweather    like i said luxury package is more expensive than the sports package looks like i am not the one that needs to do some more research,louiswei
1504,October 2006,cars in this segment practically all require a 1000 brake job at 2yr 2530k mark nowadays due to the pads they are using now in order to get great 700 numbers well within the time span of even a 36mo lease so the buyerleaser would have to pay for it if wear items not covered bmw has all service and wear items included in purchase price whereas the other mfrs do not    so i would take that into account when crossshopping the free oil changes are cheap and nearly irrelevent but the brake job and clutch replacement if your driving condition involves heavy clutch wear is not cheap if you have to pay for it,brightness04
1505,October 2006,rocky you are either crazy or have gone mad that sentence is probably true with all the nonm bmw but i honestly dont think the ctsv new or old can flat out blow the doors off the bmw and bmw    the current cts is faster in a straightline than the bmw and yes the bmw will outrun it i was referring to the 0809 ctsv which will have no less than 500 hp rurmor also says it could have 600 superv power from bluedevil engine    acura maybe but i dont like caddys chance to attract the below30 crowd bmw has the ability to attract younger buyers with their entry level product bmw and keep them as loyal customers while they move up the ladder to the 5 6 and 7 series so far i havent seen the cts to have the ability of doing the same for caddy yet also another problem for caddy is that there is not a strong upper lineup the sts is respectable but after compare it to bmw e m and gs then it becomes laughable i am not even going to go to dts since its definitely not up to par to compete with the other flagships based on the assessment ill say that caddy is having trouble to attract younger buyers and at the same time also having trouble to turn them into loyal customers so even though you rocky are very optimistic about caddys future me however is not so much    okay fair enough i agree the upper class need more to be competitive with their german and japanse rivals    infiniti is doing the same thing and doing it well with the g and the m seems to be a good candidate of a potential upgrade the missing piece right now for infiniti is that it doesnt have a respectable flagship yet i am pretty sure they are working very hard to come up with the next q once that piece is in place infiniti could become a potential force to be reckon with if i am bmw ill be watching them very closely more than any other manufactures    agreebut what about lexus     acura has a winner in tl but failed to provide a next one up in their lineup i really dont see the rl as a serious competitor among the bmw e gs and m group with a v6 they also dont have a large luxury sedan to go head to head with other flagships    yeah its going to take that v10 rl to bring back some credibility to the upper markets    last but not least lexus was in the similar situation as caddy with an olderage customer base however lexus has a very strong upper lineup way stronger than caddy with their gs and ls so all they have to do is to create a winner in the bottom then they should be fine seems to me that the new is is doing its part to help out the age group imbalance situation and hopefully lexus can learn from a few mistakes in the current is no stick soft and implementing into the next generation    agree lexus has a good playbook and have been running it to perfection quite a few years now    rocky,rockylee
1506,October 2006,the current cts is faster in a straightline than the bmw    you are kidding me right i hope you meant the current ctsv instead of cts,louiswei
1507,October 2006,back to the main topic at hand wow you did a great deal on the 330i    its the first model year of the e90 no less    i believe bg got his e90 through ed allowing him to save more ,ggesq

1510,October 2006,thats what i meant sorry for the error    rocky,rockylee
1511,October 2006,im not what source you are using    the source i used is call wwwlexuscom    now i rest my case,louiswei
1512,October 2006,righto in configuring a bmw i used a little known website called bmwusacom,kdshapiro
1513,October 2006,now i seriously think that for the last couple days rocky is just having some fun with us and we are just all dumb enough to play along    its either that ori am not even going to go there,louiswei
1514,October 2006,rocky lives in the future caddy for all i for one dont share his optimism hp will never be the be all and end all the ctsv will surely attract buyers but i predict far fewer than he believes    rocky do you have gm stock,kdshapiro
1515,October 2006,caddy cant count on their vseries cars to survive just like bmw doesnt rely heavily on the mseries those are the halo cars which function is to attract customers into the show room of course there are also many rich people out there are willing to spend big bucks on the halo cars but they are after all the minority the success of bmw is built on their bread and butter  the 3series without having a winner in the entry level market bmw could be well in trouble regardless if they have a 1000 hp 100 mpg bmw or bmw with that in mind if caddy cannot produce a winner in the mainstream market entrylevel i seriously doubt that itll be successful down the road,louiswei
1516,October 2006,rocky do you have gm stock    if i do its in my 401k plan i dont own any stock outside of that    rocky,rockylee
1517,October 2006,well the one i priced up using a lexus salesmen was 47295 matched the same msrp i gave the link to the dealership was park place in big d im confuse why you guys are getting different msrps than me     rocky,rockylee
1518,October 2006,ive used them to and get a bmw like i want for 53k with a few accessories    rocky,rockylee
1519,October 2006,now i seriously think that for the last couple days rocky is just having some fun with us and we are just all dumb enough to play along    its either that ori am not even going to go there    ive been wondering the same thing about you guys    rocky,rockylee
1520,October 2006,rocky lives in the future caddy for all i for one dont share his optimism hp will never be the be all and end all the ctsv will surely attract buyers but i predict far fewer than he believes    hp and tq certainly help along with a real world interior where i can stuff a 800lb gorilla in the back seat p    rocky,rockylee
1521,October 2006,got it so what car in here appeals to you and why you can have the detroit torque im way past that i want a quality drive with the detroit torque unfortunately i cant afford a bugatti    detroit came up with something in production with 1000 bhp since when    da,dandrews1
1522,October 2006,why bother spending that kinda of money when you can get a 1000 hp caddy v16 for alot less p    rocky,rockylee
1523,October 2006,well i configured my car and got 45k this was 4k more than my e46 seems reasonable for more horsepower and more options    edit  it is true if you configure mercedes benz porsche and bmw with every available option under the sun you will get very high msrp numbers nobody i know does this sort of thing except for rockylee at this price point    so rocky what is the msrp of a 2008 ctsv with every available option you cant bash the 53k 335 until you tell us this one little thing,kdshapiro
1524,October 2006,because you get a caddy which for a lot of people is not a postive thing,kdshapiro
1525,October 2006,why is rocky stuck in the near term future talking about the hypothetical 2008 ctsv get with it the 2020 g75 will literally flyhover and get 100 mpgrunning on water p,quasiactuary
1526,October 2006,why bother spending that kinda of money when you can get a 1000 hp caddy v16 for alot less      did i not say production that caddy is not production  its a concept car that likely will never see the light of day     if we want to start playing the game of whatif then we could go for the 19l honda engines out of their f1 cars that put out over 1200 bhp  but with an expected engine life of approx 68 hours    please stick to things that exist    we can all outtrump each other with whatif games and conjecture we can do that until all connissantions turn into gibberish of my favourite brand is better than your favourite brand    for example  an article recently came out about the new land rover lsubaru with a hybrid gaselectric system that generates 160 bhp at each wheel meaning 640 bhp total    if i were to take your approach i might read this article and come up with the following diatribe    that would make it the most powerful suv ever in a minisuv format and it will rule all suv sales and nobody can come up with anything to touch it and land rover will come out of the shadows it has been living in and everyone else will go out of business because nobody else can touch that    doesnt make much sense or lend me much credibility if i start making impossible connections does it    da,dandrews1
1527,October 2006,agreed we havent even seen the preproduction version of the 2008 cts set to debut at the detroit auto show next year the above statements read as if someone believed lutz wagoner and co hook line and sinker when they said that the new cts will turn gm around an inline v6 with turbo and all the fancy gadgets and gizmos would only serve to make the cts competitive not ahead of the class if the cts has the driving dynamics of the bmw 3 series with the interior of audi and the electronics of acura and lexus along with the comfort of the tl and the pricing of infiniti then it will truly be at the top of its class    like it or not we can only compare the 2007 cts    host why is the cadillac sts part of the entry level luxury performance sedan list up above did the database burp or did my eyes deceive me surprise,allargon
1528,October 2006,host why is the cadillac sts part of the entry level luxury performance sedan list up above did the database burp or did my eyes deceive me surprise    as rocklee pointed out 53k for a loaded bmw puts it in sts territory so i guess its not really a far reach for the entry level luxury performance sedans category blush,kdshapiro
1529,October 2006,so rocky what is the msrp of a 2008 ctsv with every available option you cant bash the 53k 335 until you tell us this one little thing    taking an educated guess it will be under 55000 you get bmw power min bmw size and options  there are no options except a dealer installed shock system that likely wont be available anymore since the rumor mill says adjustable magnaride will be standard but we will see the superv test car had 600 hp which would mean it would blow the doors off of anything bmw makes including the beloved overpriced yuppie bmw p    i love picking on you guys a 50k cadillac smoking a 100k bmw is priceless blush    rocky    bottomline the 20082009 ctsv with,rockylee
1530,October 2006,edit  it is true if you configure mercedes benz porsche and bmw with every available option under the sun you will get very high msrp numbers nobody i know does this sort of thing except for rockylee at this price point    my god youd think they would be standards when you are spending that kind of dough you can have your pleather bmw and ill be riding in extreme comfort sipping on a starbucks suzukig not only you in your pleather stripped overpriced bmw i will be suzukig both of your buddys in there 08 bmw and bmw p    life subaru and the pursuit of blowing the doors off bmw not only in straightline performance but also around the curves p    aint i a stinka    rocky,rockylee
1531,October 2006,one more note here on this where leasing is a definite advantage is if the vehicle is used as part of a business such as a realtor or other sales person there are distinct tax advantages of leasing versus an outright purchase for commercial vehicles    but for individuals leasing is virtually 100 more expensive in the long run over a purchase,mikefm58
1532,October 2006,i agree that lease is cheaper than the depreciation hit in resale value my lease is 12000 miles3yrs and will probably go for 800 for extra miles 4 months before lease end the extra cost for lease vs buy is because you need to lease twice vs buying and keeping 6 years    if you buy and keep the car over 6 years you probably are flirting with 100k so depreciation levels out in the later years but basically the maintenancerepair costs increase fast the resale is low and hit is high vs original cost    the savings in buying comes after year 6 but the car is basically getting tired in at least some major drive train parts but if the car stays sound you start saving in repair costs,circlew
1533,October 2006,i bet they are getting near retail for the bmw right     rocky,rockylee
1534,October 2006,if you buy and keep the car over 6 years you probably are flirting with 100k so depreciation levels out in the later years but basically the maintenancerepair costs increase fast the resale is low and hit is high vs original cost  any car these days should have minimal maintanence costs at 6 yrs72000 miles if that is the assumption on miles driven and length of loan unless of course you are driving something like a bmw or mb which owners should trade off before the warrantyfree service periods expire  a friend had an older 328 before bmw had to offer their service progdodge nothing really wrong with the car took it in for the 40000 mile scheduled service and got it back 230000 later  absurd  since when do simple brake jobs cost 120000 and simple tuneups 60000 although the german cars do maintain high values used the gross dollar hit is ludricrous compared with most of the japanese makes  the reason why the lease rates tend to be much higher but in any case  most of the real money saved by purchasing is actually realized after the vehicle is paid off so that from a financial standpoint it does make sense to accelerate that process as much as possible even if your monthly bill is doubled,captain2
1535,October 2006,well i guess we are on two different planets if you trade in your car you only pay tax on the difference therefore the tax you overpaid on the first purchase will go back to you after the trade in    thats dependent on state in ca your tradein does not count for squat on taxes trade in a 40k car for a 40k car and youre still down 4k on taxes    second the residual value after 3 year lease is very close to trade in for bmw that is    ive owned a couple bmw now theres a pervasive myth they dont lose much value    and please don146t quote me kbb or edmunds as they are not even close on some models and makes i spend my share on dealers auctions and i can assure you bmw in a good condition will bring good money    not from what i see bmw lose insane amounts of value quickly after year 3 like everything else the slide slows    again if you lease you always pay more at lease the money factor if you are good negotiator    babble thats just ignorant ive proven you wrong already youre talking but not making any sense youre using terms like always and yet you dont seem to understand them my last lease i saved thousands leasing chevroletly because the car took a huge hit on depreciation and the tax savings,blueguydotcom
1536,October 2006,bet they are getting near retail for the bmw right     check the bimmer boards people have been getting overinvoice deals on the bmw already bmw are a commodity just like a honda fit massive competition  essentially anyone paying msrp for one is getting taken for a ride,blueguydotcom
1537,October 2006,this may not meant much but hondaing to edmunds    2007 bmw bmw zip code 30360 metro atlanta    msrp 41295 including 695 destination charge  tmv 41295    so yes apparently for right now the new 3coupe is selling around the sticker    i know people like blueguydotcom will come back with the ed option which allows one to get one below invoice however i think with the ed one should also take the airplane ticket hotel cost and any misc cost into consideration i am pretty sure that if one can get a good deal on the ticket and hotel the overall cost should still come below the noned price but it would not be that significant    its not that people are lazy to pick up their cars in europe however i dont like the idea that i have to wait 3 month or is it 6 for my car to arrive after i picked it up also a trip to europe is just not as attractive to me comparing to a trip to china or taiwan but thats just me,louiswei
1538,October 2006,even without ed you can get them for a bit over invoice people are really myopic about saving some dough say youre in some podunk flyoverstate and the one bmw dealership wont budge on price check bimmer boards and find a large city nearby that does have competition some email blasting will nail down deals quickly hop a jetblue ted swa flight after you do the deal onlineoverthephone and pick up your car for a quick drive back if thatll get you a bmw at 5001000 over invoice v mrp thats worth it    living in socal weve got bmw dealerships on all over theres so much competition that a car like the bmw starts getting negotiated prices below msrp before theyre ever delivered,blueguydotcom
1539,October 2006,oh blueguy i am pretty sure the bmw are flying out of the dealer lot with price below msrp like i said usually the edmunds tmvs are off for some reason i wouldnt be surprised to find out that the bmw are selling for about 1000 under msrp i know for people like you thats not that great of a deal but compare to many suckers whom are paying msrp thats not that bad at all  especially for a hot car like bmw    i agree with you on that if people truly want to land a great deal they should shop around the coutry when i bought my lexus back in april i found out that i can get probably another 1000 to 1500 off the deal i got in atlanta if i buy it from dealers in cali however with the school and many interviews lining up back them a trip to cali to pick up the car just seems not logical to me also since i was planning to finance my car for at least 4 years 1000 difference about 20 dollars per month is just not that significant after all the bottom line is would i want to get a better deal than the one i got 1500 off msrp yes but after taking everything into consideration it seems more reasonable for me to buy it from my local dealership,louiswei
1540,October 2006,two comments    1 i agree that you need to draw the value line somewhere when it comes to saving money my business partner with a net worth in the solid 8 figure range considered importing a honda honda from canada a few years ago to save an extra 1000 on the exchange rate needless to say hes a great lawyer and investor in our company but i handle the financial decisions that example aside i have found it unnecessary to go accross country or outside the country to do a little arbitrage bargaining    2 leasing vs buying blueguydotcom may be an exception but i always seem to have the strongest negotiating position when i can write a check for an instock car and dare the dealer to rip it up edmunds tmv on my 2002 s2000 was 36000 yes 3200 over msrp the saturday before thanksgiving in 2001 i walked out with one for 32k even the discount on my 2005 911s cab was even more substantial at one year and 10000 miles i could sell it for at worst 89000 less than i paid for it about 50 of what the annual lease payments would be i am in a lucky state that recognizes trade in values on taxes i am of the general opinion that when you introduce another party to a transaction  ie a leasing company or financial institution  they need to make money to stay in business if in fact they have a cost of capital that is significantly below mine they might be able to do that and still offer me some value in return but for a lot of people that internal cost of capital could be a 67 home equity loan with the interest being tax deductible thats hard to beat,habitat1
1541,October 2006,habitat dealers make less money if you pay cash for a car its actually a better deal for them to sell the car lower and get you on their financing the bank pays them back instantly and they get a cut of the finance rate    actually had a dealership tell me straight up if i financed through them and then paid off the loan instantly theyd sell me the car at a lower price weird but true    i totally agree that quite often leasing for the shortterm buyer quite often really isnt a great deal without a tax deduction but there are exceptions,blueguydotcom
1542,October 2006,check the bimmer boards    what bmw boards would you recommend    it will be interesting to see when people start modding the 335 thats one of the beauties of turbo engines i must admit i would be a bit leery of chipping a bmwat least if the electrical issues i keep hearing about are true and especially in a 1st year model which typically get new mappings in subsequent years which can override the mods,pmvi
1543,October 2006,thats dependent on state in ca your tradein does not count for squat on taxes trade in a 40k car for a 40k car and youre still down 4k on taxes    i was not aware of that i live in ny and we only pay tax on the difference of the selling price and trade in you might want to elect a new governor next time around this is ripoff    ive owned a couple bmw now theres a pervasive myth they dont lose much value not from what i see bmw lose insane amounts of value quickly after year 3 like everything else the slide slows    i146m telling you how it is in ny ca may be different still don146t get where you getting this from do you have the data to support your argument  or is it coming from personal experience    babble thats just ignorant ive proven you wrong already youre talking but not making any sense youre using terms like always and yet you dont seem to understand them my last lease i saved thousands leasing chevroletly because the car took a huge hit on depreciation and the tax savings    i guess you did not read my post or decided to ignore it your 2000 so called savings came form 4000 tax which would not be the case here in ny how should i know that you getting rippedoff on taxes in ca  i146m telling you again depreciation is generally in line with residual for bmw i find it strange that you are so good in negotiating buying price for a new vehicle but can not negotiate good selling price for vehicle you are selling,pg48477
1544,October 2006,while i agree with you on the leasing vs cash deal one thing you left out was the accumulated interest one would pay through out the loan    rocky,rockylee
1545,October 2006,i was working off a lease v cash model you are correct if you take out a loan the numbers change even more,blueguydotcom
1546,October 2006,okay i do respect your negotiating tactics on cars    rocky,rockylee
1547,October 2006,dealers make less money if you pay cash for a car its actually a better deal for them to sell the car lower and get you on their financing the bank pays them back instantly and they get a cut of the finance rateactually had a dealership tell me straight up if i financed through them and then paid off the loan instantly theyd sell me the car at a lower price    replay what you are saying if the dealer makes more money if a buyer finances a car that must mean the buyer is paying so much in financing costs as to allow the fiancing company to give a kickback to the dealer and i agree that may be the case but when my cost of funds is under 4 after tax i sure as hell am not going to pay 8 on a car loan or a lease money factor that translates to that kind of interest rate    i havent tried the idea of financing a car so the dealer gets his cut up front and then paying the loan off immediately thereafter but i suspect the financing company would get wise to this tactic pretty quickly and put the kabosh on it or have a substantial prepayment penalty  loan fee to the buyer to cover the kickback    its pretty simple really there is only one source of revenue in this equation  you the buyer how many businesses do you want to support with your revenues i dont even deal with sales people any more and surprise always get a better deal directly from the sale manager by cutting out that middle person    again i think we agree there are particular circumstances in which you can game the system to your advantage i wouldnt mind sticking it to a finance company if it didnt cost me anything and the dealer gave me a piece of their kickback but the payoff needs to be good enough or the free cocktails strong enough for me to spend a couple of hours with finance guy that probably struggled through high school math,habitat1
1548,October 2006,be careful when dealing with the sales manager my brotherinlaw was a car salesman and says that the customer could almost always get a better deal from a salesman rather than the manager because the salesman is usually hungrier for the sale remember always be careful that you are getting treated the way you expect to be,esfoad
1549,October 2006,the dealer assumes correctly that a huge percentage of the people he finances will run the contract to completion or trade the car  the note in upside down so does the bank or finance organization that pays him to use them    unlike you i have financed cars at the dealer only to pay off the note a few months later he wins i win  the stinkin bank loses boo hoo i always ask if  read the fine print to verify theres any prepayment penalty anyone remember the rule of 78    i paid straight cash for the car i drive now but got a better deal on my wifes newer vehicle by financing it for a short time through the dealers bank,cdnpinhead
1550,October 2006,anyone remember the rule of 78    wow  if you need to finance a car thru a lender thats precomputing front loading interest probably illegal now then you probably are in deep ship financially    and btw banks rarely lose they work with the golden rule he that has the gold rules as it should be,ontop
1551,October 2006,almost every car dealership adds points to a loan thats not through a manufacturer afaik its standard practice,blueguydotcom

1553,October 2006,i know 10 people with bmw  presently sure thats not a scientific study but its a pretty good representation of folks with 3 series to 7 series cars given my experience with 2 bmw and that of every person i know personally i feel extremely safe saying bmw are not well made that wont stop me from getting bmwit will simply ensure i only lease them    and in any case tell us about your lexus with no problems that drives like a pig and bmw owners will tell you about driving    i have a 2006 e90 330i right now the brakes grind the ac stops working the comfort access works intermittenly    my 03 330i had a laundry list of problems and some bmw could never fix dont patronize me like im some kid off the street who has never been around a bmw    i know exactly one guy who swears by one of his bmw  an e30 352 his e39 540 on the otherhand has cost him thousands upon thousands for tranny electrical and brake work,blueguydotcom
1554,October 2006,habitat agree with your post pal ive had salesmen refuse to help me out with after sale work because i wanted to go directly to the salesmanger what i mean by after sale work is going over the cars features thankfully im a self study and know how most of the stuff works anyways from reading literature about them in magazines and other sources    in my experience going to the salesmanger has saved me hours of time that i could be out spending with my new ride instead of watching the salesmen ice me with the back n forth tatic    rocky,rockylee
1555,October 2006,the volkswagon volkswagen all the reviews ive read remarked at how rocksolid they are i like the interior and exterior its ashame the w engine went away didnt they have some very severe customer service issues  would of liked to seen a turbocharged w engine version    the new car though has decent performance wish ya could get a stick and a bit more power in a high performance version perhaps in the near future  didnt this car lack pwr seats or something which was a major gripe   off my memory    rocky,rockylee
1556,October 2006,an entry lux performance sedan    i know a loaded volkswagen can well be as nicely equipped as any cars that we discuss here but it just doesnt belong in this group because    1 volkswagen is not a lux brand  2 a little lacking on the performance side    if we are to add volkswagen into the discussion we might as well add the followings too    honda honda v6 manual  subura subaru,louiswei

1562,October 2006,thanks  great photos except one the audi photo looks much poorer quality than the others    i dont know if i get to comment as i am mainly a lurker here but a respectable lurker but i think the tl and the is are the most pleasing dashes  they are a little too lux for me but they are soooothing the audi and bmw gauges are by far the best there is something about no nonsense somewhat retro teutonic guages that evoke high end machines to me wood interiors on these smaller german cars seem to clash with their bauhaus glass and steel messerschmidt effect    purple and baby blue colors on gauges just seem like sacriledge to me except they fit perfectly on the g for the life of me i cannot figure out infinitis love of flashy old ladyoriented interior glitz that clock looks like a womens watch infiniti interiors spell liberace and myrtle beach retirement communities for me the cadillac yes my fellow americans we have met the enemy and he is us    btw i think saab fits here but you have to sit in the wrap around saab interior to appreciate its slavic modernism,edwardsf
1563,October 2006,  they fit perfectly on the g for the life of me i cannot figure out infinitis love of flashy old ladyoriented interior glitz that clock looks like a womens watch infiniti interiors spell liberace and myrtle beach      ive enjoyed the discussions of interiors  gauges but didnt comment until now i completely agree with what you posted    and then to top it off i dont find the cts interior so offensive as everyone else apparently does,cdnpinhead
1564,October 2006,well not everybody blush but with car interiorsexteriors the photos never seem to do them justice either positive or negative the bmw interior pales in comparison yet when i get in a bmw interior it is all about the driving even idrive i love the orange gauges the lexus feels like my living room i want to recline and go to sleep    its interesting to read about peoples preferences when it comes to cars,kdshapiro
1565,October 2006,actually if you want to go by the best interiors of late id say nissaninfinti have the most modern looking interiors bmw and audi use to have the best but it seems they as of late let ray charles design them surprise    my favoritest interior of all the cars made for model year 2007 is the volvo volvos volvo has arguably the best interior design ive ever seen with the new volvo  it is a real eyestopper of modern art shades    rocky,rockylee
1566,October 2006,i love ray charles really dont like modern interiors like nissan infiniti is more upscale easier to like    the bmw interiors are classic meant for driving not lounging no visual clutter no visual distraction controls are easy to use easy to find,kdshapiro
1567,October 2006,well these are my opinions and unfortunately i cant help the blinde p    bmw interiors lack a artistic design yuk     rocky,rockylee
1568,October 2006,so would you recommend the new e320 bluetec    yes i would the e has supposedly been gutted for 07 and should prove to be more reliable but sadly the reality of buying a mercedes benz is that reliabilty isnt a given anymore that said    my marketing director has a 2005 e320 cdi which she likes but it has had more problems in two years than her former e300 turbodiesel had in four years    the main things ive seen about these is that people are getting bad gas hondaing to service advisors last week while getting a service i was talking with a e320 cdi owner and she said the service adviser told her which stations to avoid despite this she said she would be getting a ml320 cdi    m,merc1

1570,October 2006,bmw interiors lack a artistic design yuk     artistic design    art is useless so is a flower  oscar wilde    i know car manus spend millions on exterior design and interior layouts yet not a single car in this class is even remotely attractive on the outside as far as interiors the e46 had the best interior of all of them by a longshot now that its gone were stuck with the current faux pas that pass as interiors not a single one of the interiors shown above is drivercentric enough they play to the rest of the cars passengers the e46 with its tighter design titledtowardthedriver dash low beltline god how i love riding in friends and family members e46s and controls rightathand epitomizes what these interiors should be    visually i couldnt care less  as long as there is no wood anywhere i just want everything of importance  gauges controls hvac stereo pointed at me the passengers can look out the window function over form  the driver is king of the domain so therefore all functions should be aimed at pleasing the driver,blueguydotcom

1572,October 2006,i dont think mr wilde was following you when he made that statement    lol    i agree blue that the e46 had a artistic interior then the school of the blinde had shop class and started designing current bmw designs shades    rocky,rockylee
1573,October 2006,spartacus the point i made by saying    yet not a single car in this class is even remotely attractive on the outside    i still bought one of these cars even though visually its ugly it reminds me of a melted buick like all the cars in this class the e90 is just plain dowdy slab sided and not the least bit interesting ditto the tl c is cts pontiac5 etc even if a car is nice to look at the would in no fashion influence my purchase the interior needs to have zero wood and be driver oriented beyond that i couldnt care much less if theres a navigation screen or a digital readout like kitts just make it functional and lacking anything that is or appears to be woodlike wood belongs on furniture not a piece of machinery,blueguydotcom

1599,November 2006,bmw is the best handling performance vehicle in this segment but its a dime a dozen on the street becoming like the toyota and honda    maybe because there is something behind the name volvo s40 in the same league as a bmw that is preposterous,kdshapiro

1609,November 2006,my original message is in reference to the title of this thread entry level luxury performance sedan  so when bmw is mentioned i refer to the 3series lexus to the is 250350etc it is amusing however to see that my comment about bmw has turned the debate into 06 bestseller although i was trying to profile the buyer of each brand    its no coincidence that the majority more than 50 of saab drivers are women because women are more fashionably sensitive than men so to some they might feel that their individuality is chevroleted plus it is fun and safe to drive a saab  on the other hand the majority of bmw drivers are men again because men crave more about handling and performance in a car than women    if you are fashionably sensitive want to have fun and feel safe try a saab    if you want a taste of scandanavian luxury style and safety try a volvo    if you want to experience peformance and handling in a vehicle try a bmw    a taste of american luxury try a cadillac    just want luxury and recognition try a mercedes benz    want to try something new or value conscious try lexus infinitiacura    looking for bmw alternative try audi,autoedu
1610,November 2006,juat purchased a pontiac5s had a 2002cic this is not an attempt to compare apples to apples the 330 had excellent handling and performance great low end accelration my issues with the car were    1 the engine was eating more and more oil between oil changes  i had to add 15 quarts in small doses after my last oil change and still have another 4k left until the next recommended oil change    2 interior quality issues buttons for the windows had broken the little pop out tray above the ashtray would not go inout properly the steering wheel wrapping was coming loose signficantlyand it was starting to look dated    3 exterior items  the driver side window would not always adjust up and down properly consequently it would get caught in the up position against the soft top when the door was closed  if you have tried a bimmer convertible you know what i mean    4 the tires for me were magnets for any piece of metal on the roadmutiple blowouts etc    5 the sport seats did not hold up very well and became uncomfortable as the car aged    despite all that i loved the car i do think people should use caution and automatically say the interior is far superior on a bmw    so the new pontiac5s is exciting and i am still trying to figure out how all the gagdets work it handles well accelration is goodneither quite at the 330 level but quite acceptable,g35new

1621,November 2006,they are overpriced because they dont benefit from partsbin engineering like the domestics the ford ford mercury mercury lincoln lincoln and lincoln are all worked over mazda 6s    the mazda 6 is a fine sporty family sedan but its no luxury car the difference between the 6lincolnford and bmw 3series is obvious the moment you climb in and close the door the bmw has such a rigid structure that you can hear and feel it when you shut the door the materials may not be plush by buick standards but the quality is a notch or two above the domestics  just touch the plastics or actuate a control stalkbutton to feel the difference drive a bmw over rough pavement or expansion joints and the rock solid structure screams quality and engineering prowess  not just suspension tuning    finally and most importantly wind the engine past redline brake late entering your favorite corner trail brake while you heel  toe downshift and then add gentle throttle to settle the car now feel for that little seam in the pavement through your hands feet and seat you know the one that tells you its time to set up for the apex get on the gas smoothly shifting weight to the rear wheels and tighten your line midcorner nail the apex and smoothly unwind the wheel while adding throttle do this repeatedly and youll understand why a bmw costs as much as it does and why its worth every penny    its all about giving the driver precise control and feedback possessing neutral razorsharp yet forgiving handling characteristics and amazingly still maintaining a compliant ride thats comfortable for everyday driving  all with 4 doors and a back seat nobody does this better than bmw,fedlawman

1625,November 2006,good point stick vs automatic does make a difference to some people  engineering a manual shift into the lincoln lincoln would be too much to ask from ford right now i think but i will bring it up with my ford buddies maybe the word will trickle to the right people that said i found the lincoln a better buy overall stick be dammed than the bmw or mb i tried i will try the bmw or a used e class within the next year before i make a decision the lincoln sure was sporty at 263hp really liked the power the ride and the interiorexterior design is perfect including the solidity at high speed i will admit it is beefier and probably would not beat your bmw or mb in a race off down hair pin turn roads its just that its got this look especially in dark colors with those chrome rimsvery beautiful talked to a mb sales person today and she said its normal to feel that way some of the north american products are actually good but the major factor she said was how i would feel about it in 5 years and upon resale or trade in the loss in value is substantial so if you want a bmw mb or jaguar xk beautiful 007 look alike car by the way you will have to pay the price myself i guess i will suffer with a lincoln unless otherwise proven wrong i firmly believe you are making a mistake not considering it comparible to bmw and mb strip the beemer and mb badges and compare car to car the lincoln lincoln is definately comparible sorry you dont share my enthusiasm you give too much credit to bmw and mb imho not having a manual stick option does not bother me in the least but my lincoln will have the navsystembeefed up stervolkswagenunroof chrome rims the luxury group and hp to boot for the same price 35k vrrrum vrrumm  i will have to deal with the resale issue after i have had years of driving pleasure with it,flash11

1633,November 2006,well in yours and a few others minds perhaps the comparo of pics further proves to me the 2007 volvo volvo might just be the best luxury car money can buy the others might do this or that better but to me even if i had 80 or 90k to just blow on any car in the segment id still pick the volvo id get more car for my money and wouldnt have to drive a car with a eyesore interior i was kinda surprised you guys didnt throw in the ls 460 i suppose you didnt want make the audi look that bad  whats up with audi anyways  whats that bmw idrive bs gadget i see on the center console  i see mercedes benz using a similar device in the new sclass i would assume after all the complaints about those devices the car manufactors would of scraped that idea confuse whats wrong with voice recognition or pushing a button  lemon    rocky,rockylee
1634,November 2006,well i was pointing out that the mercedes benz and bmw are overpriced for what you get when you can get a vastly bigger and better optioned out competitor for less money well the namebrand factor starts to wear a bit thin    but for luxury performance undre 30k  something has to give and i favor luxury over absolute performance if i had to choose which to go for    plekto i agree with youbmw mercedes benz and audis are like going to the mall and paying sean john prices at dillards or marshall fields when levis will fit the bill at meijers at 5075 of the cost so childish imho    i guess some couldnt be seen walking out of anything but a yuppie store with the so called best    rocky,rockylee

1636,November 2006,good post flash11 you also can take your savings and if you choose you can beef up the 35 with aftermarket performance upgrades for a fraction of the cost those bimmer drivers spent they might beat you in resale but they better have opted for the extended warranty because those bimmers arent cheap later on in life where your lincoln wont be expensive to repair and maintain so let em talk resale but you i both know once the bmw get a certain age they will try to sell it asap to avoid maintence and repair costs    rocky,rockylee

1638,November 2006,well that depends alot on how long he decides to keep it if hes going to drive a car for a couple of years perhaps you are right if he holds on to it hes definitely better off owning the lincoln    is the lincoln going to depreciate 1015k faster over the  of years he owns the car   2938k lincoln vs 3850k bmw since we dont know the actual marketvalue of the lincoln or bmw we wont know the truth for a couple of years we can only assume hes better off owning the bmw in a average lease cycle with the same amount of mileage allowed per yr however if you factor in cost of ownership if he holds onto it outside of warranty the lincoln will easily save him money on repairmaintence costs along with a significant lower price paid up front    rocky,rockylee

1640,November 2006,the reason you got slammed is because youre posting like the buying public is stupid and more specifically we are stupid comparing an audi with an hyundai who are you kidding    in your mind the volvo represents the best thing going if that were a fact volvo would be ruling the world instead of being owned by ford the volvo has its place but i think the entire model line is ugly and unbalanced and drives the same way the volvo has nothing in comparison to the ls audi or 7 series it is not better looking better handling or has a better interior it is cheaper in eveyway possible than the luxury class cars you mentioned    in addition the 335 will also dust every car in this segment in performance you cannot do enough aftermarket upgrades to nonturbo models to make it as fast as a turbo a little chip in the 335 will make it even faster you get what you pay for    if price is your main concern you should not be looking at luxury automobiles as a comparison because the volvo falls short compared to them in everything maybe you should head on over the high end luxury marquees forum and post an audi is the equivalent of an hyundai see how you can convince these folks that own the automobiles maybe an hyundai would be the car you are seeking,kdshapiro
1641,November 2006,here is the cost of the comparable bmw with x drive the car cost 7k more up front residual is 23k after 39 months bottom line difference is 1000    2007 bmw 328 ix 4 dr sedan        window sticker      44770    purchase price      44385    odometer      0 miles            progdodge      bank lease a    lease payment      730 per month    term      39 months    mileage allowance      39000 total miles    residual value      23244    purchase option      23594    money factor      000241    gap insurance      included    down payment      0    due at signing    730  sales tax and title fees  includes first months payment    i would go with this car considering the performance difference with respect to the extra cost and better warrantee coverage    regards  ow,circlew
1642,November 2006,i see you are back chevroleting your deepest feelings and exquisite opinions of cars youve never driven    i have to assume that is the case with the volvo volvo because if you had you would realize that one could put all of the engine upgrades in the world on that car and you still have handling and driving dynamics that are at the bottom of the class at least the performance class that you are trying to put it in if you just want to save money ill sell you my 1995 nissan nissan 5speed with 154k miles for 4000 and you will have a car that is more fun to drive than a 2007 volvo volvo anyone that drives a volvo volvo and comes away with an excited feeling needs to bottle that and sell it to the pharmaceutical industry    its fine by me that you dont feel the need to have your butt in a designer label suit to feel well dressed but you really need to get that butt in the cars you opine on if you expect to have any credibility your practice of reading magazines and polling friends and family to form your own opinions is a sad commentary,habitat1
1643,November 2006,how could one poll a friend and come up with audihyundai that is beyond me that is something you make up in the back of your mind even without ever have driven an audi everything ive read about the auto points me in the direction that it is a hot contender in the luxury space,kdshapiro
1644,November 2006,what  661 a month  if you upside down 10k on your trade in maybe confuse also you wont pay msrp for the lincoln like most do for a bimmer    you can redcarpet lease a lincoln for in the threehundreds with zero down    rocky,rockylee
1645,November 2006,as a passenger in an volvo and audi guess which one i wish i had the difference in desirability is not with the volvo from a drivers standpointbut my wife cares not for performance of the drive rather the safe transportation in style she actually considered this car volvo for a brief moment while i was shopping last year    so i presented the bentley continental gt to her as one our next vehicle considerations she mistakenly thought she had seen this new chrysler in a nearby mall parking lot  i helped her with the id    she is more enamored with the new 750 in black and thats a steep discount    regards  ow,circlew
1646,November 2006,people come to the board and start posting stuffs from what they read and hear rather than their personal experience although i dont agree with blueguydotcom on a lot of topics but i have respect for him because everything he has posted is from his own experience unlike someone else here    for the sake of it    if i buy the car based on magazine my rear end would be in the 330i  if i buy the car based on best bang for the buck my rear end would be in the pontiac5  if i buy the car based on brand loyalty my rear end would be in the tl  if i buy the car based on polling friends my rear end would be in the porsche boxter    and last but not least    if i buy the car based on polling family members my rear end would in a toyota or honda    at the end my rear end is not in any of those cars listed above why because i went out test drived most of them except the boxter and came to the conclusion that the lexus is the car for me    for those people who thinks the volvo volvo 93 and lincoln belong in this segment please go out and test drive the bmw and come back to tell us that those cars are in the same level performancewise as the bimmer at the same time go sit in a lexus and tell us that they are in the same level luxurywise as the baby lex    i rest my case,louiswei
1647,November 2006,1 all i said was i thought the volvo volvo was a worthy luxury car alternative when compared to the likes of the ls audi and i got slammned for it fine i can handle it2 i can afford much more than a hyundai 3 im just defending volvo and lincoln from getting steamrolled in this forum a guy buys a lincoln and likes it and then gets hammered for liking it better than a bmw a ctsv will spank the bmw and current bmw in a race so what  if you bimmer buffs think the bmw is your saving grace that will be topped by the 600 hp ctsv even if you guys use a cheaters chip again who really cares     we like what we like but saying a volvo isnt in the same league as the audi audi is ludacris imho you are paying a extra 30k to have 4rings on your grill if thats what you want to do  which i doubt many in this forum will buy a audi thats okay by me you have my blessings    rocky,rockylee
1648,November 2006,i see you are back chevroleting your deepest feelings and exquisite opinions of cars youve never driven    habitat honestly how many people in here really have driven cars they write about dude they claim it but im honest and say i havent seriously think about it driving a 330i doesnt qualify one driving a bmw i cant drive the 07 volvo because its not out yet the local bmw dealer doesnt have any bmw yet to drive yet hes still trying to sell his 06 leftover 330is    i have to assume that is the case with the volvo volvo because if you had you would realize that one could put all of the engine upgrades in the world on that car and you still have handling and driving dynamics that are at the bottom of the class    read above post     at least the performance class that you are trying to put it in if you just want to save money ill sell you my 1995 nissan nissan 5speed with 154k miles for 4000 and you will have a car that is more fun to drive than a 2007 volvo volvo anyone that drives a volvo volvo and comes away with an excited feeling needs to bottle that and sell it to the pharmaceutical industry    i guess we all have different opinions on what performance should be is a audi audi a performance car  i see many people blab about cars that they claim are performance cars in here so i assumed the volvo with its 315 hp and 4cs chassis would qualify it as a performance sedan     its fine by me that you dont feel the need to have your butt in a designer label suit to feel well dressed but you really need to get that butt in the cars you opine on if you expect to have any credibility your practice of reading magazines and polling friends and family to form your own opinions is a sad commentary    i guess i could lie like many others in this forum and say i driven this car and that car and bs the forum confuse    please    rocky,rockylee
1649,November 2006,i was being sarcastic about the audi interior you guys love so much it has so much wax polish on it looks fake    audi imho hasnt had a great interior since the old a200s    rocky,rockylee
1650,November 2006,1 all i said was i thought the volvo volvo was a worthy luxury car alternative when compared to the likes of the ls audi and i got slammned for it    you got slammed for it because you were comaring apples to oranges like always nobody would slam you if you compare the volvo to something like the m and gs    2 i can afford much more than a hyundai    good for you so lets drop the hyundai you were the one who brought it up    3 im just defending volvo and lincoln from getting steamrolled in this forum a guy buys a lincoln and likes it and then gets hammered for liking it better than a bmw    its fine that people buy lincoln over the bimmer because they like it better however that doesnt mean the lincoln is better in performance nor luxury than the bmw also just because they are roughly in the same price range doesnt mean that the lincoln belongs in this segment those people got hammered because like you they are comparing apples to oranges not because they like the lincoln better    a ctsv will spank the bmw and current bmw in a race so what     what race a drag race wanna put these 3 in nuburing for a couple laps and see which one comes out as the winner    we like what we like but saying a volvo isnt in the same league as the audi audi is ludacris imho    rock in your instinct please tell us what percentage of people whom shop for a ls audi 7er and sclass will consinder the volvo as an alternative your answer will indicate how much you know about the upper end auto market,louiswei

1654,November 2006,circlew    a bmw sounds very interesting hmmmmm surprise you say its going to be faster yet surprise holy smokes  i wonder how much more the diesel is going to cost     it will be worth looking at especially if it get 35 mpg and its faster yet surprise    rocky,rockylee
1655,November 2006,does anyone have further details    not good news bmw diesels wont be coming here in the near future    from reuters nov 22    while volkswagen and mercedes benz already sell diesels in the us market bmw has no plans to do so any time soon and declines to use the bluetec name currently being used to help sell mercedes benzmercedes benz e 320s that run on ultra low sulphur diesel in the us    the worlds biggest premium carmaker bmw a fierce rival of daimlerchrysler luxury mercedes benz brand first wants to develop a ureabased technology to reduce nitrogen oxides before considering a sustained entry into the us diesel market,designman
1656,November 2006,when i first heard about this i thought to myself bmw wont go for this they arent going to work with mercedes benz volkswagen and audi on anything if they can help it cost is the only reason they took at seat at the hybrid table with them that and their general dont care attitude about hybrids so they figure theyll let the others do most of the work and if it doesnt work about the loss will be minimal    i just knew bmw wasnt going to to participate here and use a mercedes benz thought up name on one of their cars hell to the no    m,merc1
1657,November 2006,thats a loss for us for sure,kdshapiro
1658,November 2006,the volvors 060 time in 54 seconds is that still slow     compare to the benchmark bmw yes,louiswei
1659,November 2006,the benchmark is 46 seconds set by the cadillac ctsv i could take a nap waiting for 60 mph to hit in the bmw p    rocky,rockylee
1660,November 2006,rocky for the last f time ctsv is not an entrylevel lux performance sedan just like the bmw and cclass amg are not as well when the lexus is500 comes out if it does it also would not be consider as one    what are the cars in this class please refer to the list on top of the board except the saab 93 imo i would put the volvor in that place if one must,louiswei
1661,November 2006,louiswei    well if the ctsv isnt a entrylevelluxury sedan then the bmw isnt either the entrylevel luxury car should be the bmw 328 i also want to know how you became the judge of the forum of what is and what isnt a entrylux car  surprise    rocky,rockylee
1662,November 2006,how many of yall think that ctsv is an entry lux performance sedan and how many of yall think that the bmw is one    my opintion  ctsv no  bmw yes,louiswei
1663,November 2006,test the volvors 060 time in 54 seconds is that still slow     yes thats the last generations numbers the new mark is sub 5 seconds,blueguydotcom
1664,November 2006,agreed ctsv is positioned against the bmw not 3 series which is the benchmark for the class,blueguydotcom
1665,November 2006,the stsv is positioned against the bmw the ctsv is closer in size to the bmwbmw    i think it boils down to thisyou guys are antigm and just because gm makes a faster better performing car than bmw bmw yall will say it doesnt compete the funny thing is the ctsv is the same size as the pontiac5 and acura tl both of which you guys say competes with the bmw confuse    leave your bias at home and recognize bmw gets its butt handed to it on a wreath and crest platter mad    rocky,rockylee
1666,November 2006,well lets see what the awd 335xi runs 060    rocky,rockylee
1667,November 2006,could get a base 335 for 39k and change you cant get a base ctsv for less than 50 just going off sticker rlee your all over the place and not making sense as usual keep up the good work,dhamilton
1668,November 2006,thats tough  but my answer would be the same for both regardless of what that answer is    why should size matter the cts is the smallest caddy available therefore its their entrylevel car    if we wanted to get real strict then wed exclude the volvo weve been talking about because the s40 is slotted beneath it likewise the tl is excluded because the acura exists so where is the line    is it size is it price is it where it falls in the manufacturers lineup    there are more cars here besides the bmw folks not everything needs to be measured against that car some folks dont want to spend 40k on a car that size end of story    if i were to decide this talk includes the entrylevel car from each luxo manufacturer then yes the cts is included however this also means the tl and volvo are excluded if we decide all engine options for each car are included then yes the bmw is allowed as well as the ctsv    however if we decide on a price cap that could be a whole different story it would include multiple entries from the same manufacturer while excluding some from others it kind of sounds like thats what some folks are shooting for here  17 ford crew 27 67 coronet rt 14 towncountry limited 09 lsubaru hse 44car history and counting,qbrozen
1669,November 2006,dan    so now your bringing in prices to justify the bmw my god talk about being all over the place who in the heck is going to buy a 39k bmw with vinyl interior  4445k is what the average bmw buyer will spend dude seriously you are the one who doesnt make sense  i can admit when im wrong some of you have to spin other peoples responses to justify to yourself worth     im not saying the ctsv is a better all around car to own or drive but the test track results speak for themselves    rocky,rockylee

1672,November 2006,louiswei is correct however a small chip in the 335 will probably make the ctsv look like a snail id be able to get a whole nights sleep and wake up refreshed btw was that time going downhill with wind at the cts tail,kdshapiro
1673,November 2006,i dont completely disagree with what you are getting at but this is not specified in the top of the discussion    an bmw is still a 3series is it not yet the top of the discussion says 3series and not 3series minus the bmw    and yes i know there is no bmw right now but there was and will be    as for your list where is the acura i pointed out in my post yeah its a 4cylinder i know but the mags and many owners seem to think its a sports sedan regardless  17 ford crew 27 67 coronet rt 14 towncountry limited 09 lsubaru hse 44car history and counting,qbrozen

1675,November 2006,is it size is it price is it where it falls in the manufacturers lineup    its not all about size not all about price and not all about where it falls in the manufacturers lineup its about where does it fall in the market,louiswei
1676,November 2006,rockylee you have got to stop this nonsense about the ctsv compared to the bmw it falls short in every performance category plus it costs 15k more than a base bmw,kdshapiro
1677,November 2006,exactly    which is why i question where the line is why the 335 but not bmw why the cts but not ctsv    if we exclude the top models like the v and m then why are we allowing any kind of engine options should we only be discussing the true entry level vehicle in this discussion that we have named entrylevel vehicles    it would make for a boring discussion however how enthusiastic can we be about the 328 vs lexus vs acura not very    so what im asking for is a clear defining line louis might be onto something  but its not quite there yet  17 ford crew 27 67 coronet rt 14 towncountry limited 09 lsubaru hse 44car history and counting,qbrozen
1678,November 2006,the fact remains it doesnt take a aftermarket chip for the cadillac ctsv to hand both the bmw bmw and bmw its nonpermissible content removed    yall can spin it anyway yall want to feel good if gm loses a comparo i give the other company a congrats take it like a man and move ongood grief confuse    rocky,rockylee
1679,November 2006,but honestly  and this is not just directed at you rocky  who the heck cares    if i wanted something based strictly on performance id get a crotch rocket and put everything on this board to shame    as shoppers especially shoppers in this category we are looking for far more than performance numbers dictate  17 ford crew 27 67 coronet rt 14 towncountry limited 09 lsubaru hse 44car history and counting,qbrozen
1680,November 2006,so what im asking for is a clear defining line louis might be onto something  but its not quite there yet    i dont know what i am onto but i think this board is dedicated to the regular models of the entry lux performance sedans whether its bmwbmw or lexus350 i think the m v and amg are all special factory tuned models which should be in a class of their own    like i said before the market decides where does a car fall for example how many of yall actually considered the bmw ctsv and c55 amg while shopping for your entry lux performance sedan i know i didnt my final 2 are lexus and 330i the bmw didnt even come across my mind however thats just me    blueguy did you consider the bmw before buying your 330i,louiswei
1681,November 2006,like i said a bmw with just basic leather interior without options is no better than a ford gt might as well save you 1015k and get you a ford since a stripped bmw isnt a luxury car geez people     rocky,rockylee
1682,November 2006,the key word being straight like pretty much every american made vehicle    whats that suppose to mean  i didnt know most bmw owners are out at the track every weeked racing around the nurenburing thus meaning great handling over straightline performance is a stupid argument since most will use the straightline performance 90 of the time    rocky    ps i can name a few american cars that out handle your bmw,rockylee

1684,November 2006,geez people     you dont think in your heart of hearts a bmw which can outhandle and out perform a ford and cost 39 to the ford 34k will be confused by anybody    same with the ctsv get a 39k bmw save 15k and beat the pants off the ctsv    get over the fact you dont think a stripped bmw isnt a luxury car the bmw is the consumate entry level vehicle and meets all of the criteria more than the other brands you have been mentioning,kdshapiro
1685,November 2006,the gms is the employee discount and can save you as much as 1531 off msrp avg is 12 though you will be into the dealers holdback money    the gmsupplier is about 5 off and a savy buyer can beat it quite easily    rocky,rockylee
1686,November 2006,lol its actually pretty funny when a car such as the lincoln has luxury features not found in a bmw and they say the lincoln isnt the luxury car confuse    rocky,rockylee
1687,November 2006,they dont say it i said it outside of this forum lincoln is not a luxury manufacturer you may feel differently imo    so by your logic the amount of luxury is controlled by the feature set of the vehicle the subaru sti has driver defined variable differential control and a watercooled intercooler not found onn 99 of all cars including the lincoln therefore it has more luxury then the lincoln,kdshapiro
1688,November 2006,i like the lincoln and its not because its sheer performance i like the bmw bmw also but my point was defending the lincoln as a true entrylux performance sedan it has more power than some of the cars mentioned on this forum and is very competitive in price it also doesnt miss on the luxury side of the equation like a stripped 39k bmw    rocky,rockylee
1689,November 2006,here is how i would group them i agree buick is out lincoln probably too some of the more expensive volkswagens are close but miss out because they are lumped in with the volkswagens    in the first group are volvo saab acura infiniti though their prestige is rising again and cadillac    next group which is more prestigious bmw audi mb jaguar minus the the xtype no one thinks this a real jaguar and lexus    while lincoln and buick have all of the bells and whistles they are not in the same category as the others because they are not perceived as being as prestigious the hyundai azerra has the bells and whistles but it misses mark for the same reason  2014 toyota xle awd 2009 rx 350 awd and 2007 honda ex,robbieg
1690,November 2006,you dont think in your heart of hearts a bmw which can outhandle and out perform a ford and cost 39 to the ford 34k will be confused by anybody    i was using the ford to be sarcastic but once i mention shelby then it becomes a different ball game i wont go there    same with the ctsv get a 39k bmw save 15k and beat the pants off the ctsv    weve already had this discussion and as i proved to you already the ctsv does everything better than the bmw    next question    get over the fact you dont think a stripped bmw isnt a luxury car    if a stripped bmw is a luxury car then a kia sophia is then also comeon dude you are losing credibility what is luxurious about a pleather bmw for god sakes it doesnt have heated seats standard which is one of the basic gadgets found in a luxury car hell my moms pontiac gtp has heated seats confuse    the bmw is the consumate entry level vehicle and meets all of the criteria more than the other brands you have been mentioning    im not debating whether or not the bmw is the best i was simpily pointing out the lincoln should be allowed to stay since it has the credentials    rocky,rockylee
1691,November 2006,hes being contrarian the way your car is configured is the way 99 of the 3 series buyers get bmw equipped i do not buy cars loaded with a lot of useless crap he does so rather than ford on performance as a criteria he fordes on doodads as a criteria nothing wrong with that different strokes for different folks    me id drive a stripper 335 anyday over an lincoln at least the smile thats plastered to my face will never go away,kdshapiro
1692,November 2006,weve already had this discussion and as i proved to you already the ctsv does everything better than the bmw    actually youve proved nothing because it isnt so    if a stripped bmw is a luxury car then a kia sophia is then also    okay by me    comeon dude you are losing credibility    please dont even go there    please stop with the ctsv it does not do one thing better than the bmw other than cost 15k more ok its slightly larger if thats your fancy wait you are referring to the 2008 model that will kill off the competition,kdshapiro
1693,November 2006,rocky what is special about heated seats honestly i dont define build quality exceptional handling and great engineering by worthless gadgetry you assign more value to doodads than the actual quality of the cars performance this is a luxury performance sedan forum not a luxury car forum youre in the wrong place  try the forum with the lexus,blueguydotcom

1696,November 2006,agree buick is out because of its fwd and soft suspension the lincoln has a sporttuned suspension and rwd which imho gives them enough clout to be mentioned    rocky,rockylee
1697,November 2006,i never said that everyone will configure their cars like me i said the majority of folks will select the options i believe bluedotguy used at 46k i would logically assume most bmw drivers will stay in the 4446k range with their bmw if you are going to spend in the mid 40s buy ya a shelby gt 500 and get a bigger smile for the same price you get a extra 200 horsepower and will be the envy of most people in your local community both young and old    rocky,rockylee

1712,December 2006,gm will probably end up by battling this out with infiniti not bmw to battle it out with bmw they will have to on up the lincoln    now if gm produce a car that was 90 of the performance at 60 of the price and the car had balance poise and grace they might have a shot    remember the pontiac5 is the 3 series closest competitor that is what gm has to aim for infinity is considered a brand that is above average in reliability so it will be interesting to see where gm goes with those statistics,kdshapiro
1713,December 2006,read car and drivers review on the volvor and owners comments    first of all the opinions of others should weigh in very little on your car of choice second of all being a lonvolkswagenme volvo fan and recent owner ive read tons of owners comments on the dedicated volvo boards the only negative ones ive ever come across usually center on the 5speed geartronic models and honestly what the heck were they expecting when they bought the automatic anyway    as others here have said you really should hold comments unless you actually drive a vehicle i suggest you try out one of the less pedestrian volvos and resist passing judgement based on anything you simply read    its not a car id lay out 40 grand for    and alot of folks agree with you which is why it doesnt sell for anywhere near 40k  17 ford crew 27 67 coronet rt 14 towncountry limited 09 lsubaru hse 44car history and counting,qbrozen

1715,December 2006,i personally hate most of what ford puts out youll notice i like volvo the bigger late 90s mercedes benz the mazda and a few others but ford    a couple of vehicles that dont belong here   lincoln  no manual sorry  manual is required has been from day one   anything else without a manual transmission no exceptions shiftomatic doesnt cut it either   lexus also is right outunderpowered the 350 is mainstream luxury  and belong in the next segment up the older lexus sportcross did belong here though  quick and fun   the cclass is out as well too 190 series plastic and fake lux and handles like a slightly improved honda mercedes benz seems to have abandoned this segment lately   the volvo s40 is a joke  toss out as well the volvo though definately belongs like the cts  it may not be a bmw but it still makes the cut    we should also add in specific models that are not quite sedans as well if like the lexus sportcross its the only manual equipped version of the vehicle for instance a small 4 door crossover might applythough ive never seen one that handles like a car instead of a truck or something thats a 4 door hatchback like the older saabs used to be or even a 2door might work like the older mercedes benz c230k it was drastically different from the other models in how it drove and yet was virtually identical inside to the sedan,plekto
1716,December 2006,indeed you could work for a consulting company that contracts with both reamaining dinosaurs to defend their awful us made cars on carspace and other forums not that i am saying that ford andor gm are getting their moneys worth but that would not be new  look at their stock price    btw werent you the yugo spokesman a couple of decades ago,edwardsf
1717,December 2006,that was one of the your more balanced posts i disagree about talking about anything that isnt a sedan though we could then add vehicles such as the x3 because it does a great sedan imitation    nah it really should be a sedan although sometimes we talk about coupes,kdshapiro

1720,December 2006,with msrp starting at 475k its the most expensive of the bunch the bmw starts at 40k the 42l is the fastest in the bunch and will outrun the ctsv especially with mods this car is more of an bmw buster than a lexusbmw buster,kdshapiro

1735,December 2006,i am not the used car expert but i highly doubt you can get a cts with the 36 and a stick shift for 15knot to mention that one would be hard to find with regard to the mercedes benz the s500 coupes are not stick shift you probably would have to look at the c230 to find a stick and i bet one would be hard to find because i doubt that many where sold with a stick a c230 coupe with a stick would be easier to find but that is a coupe also i havent priced mazda but i would guess that they are above 15k the lexus came in a stick starting in 2002 and one of these may slide into your price range saabs are definitely in your price range but do you really want a used saab with regard to volvo an r is clearly out of your price range you may find a t5 but like the saab reliability may be an issue i am not a bmw expert so i will let someone else answer that one and let you know how old you will have to go to get below 15k also if luxury isnt necessarily you thing you may want to try a subaru  2014 toyota xle awd 2009 rx 350 awd and 2007 honda ex,robbieg

1740,December 2006,concerning the bmw 5 series  2000 bmw 11376 12975 14702  like the price but how reliable are they should i get the v8 model insteadthough it seems awfully heavy at 3600 lbs    the 2000 e39 is considered to be very reliable with but a few problem areas ball joints radiator and water pump and even those have since been mitigated with replacement parts    given that my normal 1200015000 mile commute year a measure that had been very stable until june of 2005 has been upset ive driven over 50000 miles since that point im looking for a 2000 bmw 5speed with both the premium package sport package and m interior sport seats and steering wheel cars so equipped typically bottom out at about 14000 and are very few and far between the good news is that assuming proper maintenance by the original owners these cars should be good for an easy quarter of a million miles without any significant maintenance dollars    ifwhen i find one the first things ill be doing to mine will be to go through the front suspension replace the water pump with a new allmetal one replace the plastic tanked radiator with an all metal one assuming this hasnt been done already flush the cooling and brake systems fit a set of low dustdustless brake pads and new rotors and any other cosmetic items that i find wanting    once gone through i figure i can get an easy 150000 to 200000 miles with only minimal meaning scheduled maintenance and few if any significant repairs    regarding the v8 fun though they may be there is one key element that im having a tough time getting over even though both the i6 and the v8 engines are have aluminum blocks the i6 sports steel sleeved cylinder bores while the v8 sports silicone impregnated cylinder bores while i have no real proof of this i suspect that the i6 mill will last longer    another thing to consider when comparing i6 to v8 engined 5series cars is the steering system on the e34 and e39 models there wasnt enough room to fit a rack and pinion system to the v8 models and as such they have a more conventional recirculating ball system i much prefer the nimbleness of the i6 models due to their lighter weight and their rack and pinion steering    best regards  shipo,shipo

1744,December 2006,if you dont like the exterior of the cts then the new redesign probably wont do much for you i declined to buy an acura tl recently despite loving the size driving dynamics complaints about the fwd and turning circle are imho overblown and interior of the car because every time i looked at it in my garage i would think i cant believe i bought an honda sick yes i know the suspension engine gadgets make it so much more but it looks like an honda despite the body kit    i love the in your face exterior of the cts a lot of people dont like american styling they can buy the mazdaudi instead of the ford ford or the toyota hyundai instead of the pontiac pontiac however a lot of people dont like the exteriors of japanese cars either    the only reason theres no cts in my garage now is due to the interior i can handle the angular padding on the doors and dash and the cheap plastic the pontiac5 has plenty too but that center stack instrument panel just hurts my eyes too much    pricing cadillacs were never cheap cars imho they shouldnt be part of the decline of their status of a brand in addition to the quality decline is the fact that there are so many cheaper older ones on the road in europe there are plenty of older audis on the road pimp my ride and top gear showcase them all the time but i almost never see older audis in the us    residuals the cts actually held its value pretty well considering it was an american car the sts ouch 35k worth of depreciation in two years it actually did well in this class the japanese 3 acura infiniti lexus in this class hold their values better than the european ones    100mph in the 14 mile yeah a lot of folks mentioned the rally cars 50k how about adding the ctsv chryslerc st8 and the boxster s base as contenders note i was too lazy to actually look up the s to see if they belong,allargon
1745,December 2006,i do like what i see of the new interior of the 08 cts but i need to sit in it to really decide the acura was ok when i shopped in 05 but i did not drive it i test drove the pontiac5 coupe but i decided on a sedan and the g sedan is not my taste either although the 07 looks far better the coupe handled great and was fat but wind noise was apparent and room and interior did not do it for me    cadillac lost some of its appeal due to quality and image loss to the elps segment the cts is a nice try but as usual missed the mark imo    i did test drive the 300c srt8 and it was great but mileageresidual was a killer i made my decision toward the end of 05 before 78barrel hit i am glad i went with the xi    regards  ow,circlew
1746,December 2006,i think a lot of posters in this forum that dissed the acura tl type s as being overpriced havent driven it it may be lacking in the horsepower dept compared to bmw lexus and infiniti but its a great driver    with all this talk about the cts getting a 2008 overhaul no one is mentioning that the cclass is getting one too,allargon

1751,December 2006,dont forget that the cts also can be had with a manual transmission and is rwd thats worth a lot to people who want a car for less than a bmw  but with better reliability and a softer ride its definately cheaper than a pontiac5 or lexus    and to be honest whats next 4 second times and 400hp being considered weak weve already crossed the threshold of what most consumers require in a car in terms of power and speed so you have to look at the total picture for instance the gm 36 engine  no hp monster but its essentially a honda or toyota engine tewchnologywise with the vvt  but in a car that is well under 30kbuick buick cxs its a very nice total package that competes well against the japanese cars in reallife driving,plekto

1759,December 2006,i believe rocky was referring to the iqs rating from jd power on global assembly plant quality here is the report    assembly plant awards    september 1 2006    toyota receives a total of four assembly plant quality awards for producing vehicles yielding the fewest defects including the platinum plant quality award for its iwate japan plant producer of the lexus es 330 the iwate plant averages 32 pp100 plant awards are based solely on scores for defects    among north and south american plants the general motors oshawa 2 plant in ontario canada which produces the buick buick and pontiac pontiac receives the gold plant quality award for a second consecutive year toyota146s georgetown ky plant which produces the toyota toyota and toyota coupeconvertible and daimlerchryslesubaru46s windsor ontario canada plant which produces the chrysler town  country caravan and grand caravan tie for the silver plant quality award    in the asia pacific region toyota146s higashifuji japan plant which produces the lexus sc 430 receives the silver plant quality award toyota146s kyushu japan plant which produces the lexus is 250is 350 lexus rx 330400h and toyota toyotatoyota hybrid and american honda146s saitama japan plant which produces the acura rl acura acura and honda honda tie for the bronze plant quality award    magna steyr the graz austria plant that assembles under contract for traditional manufacturers receives the gold plant quality award for europe magna steyr produces the bmw x3 mercedes benzmercedes benz eclasswagon and the saab 93 convertible bmw146s dinvolkswagening germany plant which produces the bmw 5 6 and 7 series receives the silver plant quality award and porsche146s valmet finland plant which produces the cayman and boxster receives the bronze plant quality award    the 2006 initial quality study is based on responses from 63607 purchasers and lessees of new 2006 modelyear cars and trucks surveyed after 90 days of ownership the redesigned iqs is based on a new 217question battery151up from 135 in previous years151to provide manufacturers with more information to improve problem determination and drive product improvement the study also groups models in a revised jd power and associates vehicle segmentation list    the 2006 study has been redesigned for the first time since 1998 improvements to the study include an enhanced questionnaire for owners to aid in identification of both defect and design problems expanded coverage of new technologies and additional details about the problems reported to help oems better identify how to address them    for more detailed findings on newvehicle quality performance as well as model photos and specs visit the jd power consumer center at wwwjdpowercom    regards  ow,circlew
1760,December 2006,i agree a new cts for 30000 would be a good deal but cadillac will never price it that low because they want to hit you with 4000 worth of options    httpwwwedmundscomnew2006cadillaccts100563998optionsresultshtmlactio  n2    select the 28l luxury package the sport package leather seats and the splitfold option    just under 30k they do price it that low and honestly the luxury package isnt really that important 28k without the extra bling like heated seats homelink and whatnot,plekto
1761,December 2006,ow that was what i was referring too    thanx    rocky,rockylee
1762,December 2006,plekto    i agree its a great deal    i however think the 08 cts will be the one worth waiting for even if its a few thousand more i know the resale values here in the tx panhandle are quite high on ctss    rocky,rockylee
1763,December 2006,true like i said  it needs a v20 refresh badly less square less stark  just polished kind of like the new mini from what i hear it will be better than the original yet still look close enough to be the same car    but rwd and a 5 speed gearbox certainly competes well with the imports,plekto
1764,December 2006,well the 08 cts will have a 6 speed auto also    rocky,rockylee
1765,December 2006,you are referring to the outgoing model 06 just like you did before with the pontiac5 i believe the previous poster and me were talking about the new cts 07 ill bet you a cts that you are not going to see a 25k incentive tag onto the upcoming new model for the first couple month theyll be flying out of the dealership at msrp as matter of fact    be honest with you i think that caddy will have a winner if they are managed to keep the same price and add a few standard equipments like leather seat keyless entrystart and blue tooth with the new cts the base model has to start below 30k and the 36 at around 34k,louiswei
1766,December 2006,louiswei    no offense but i still think you mean the 2008 cadillac cts right  the 2008 is going to be the new redesign    if i do decide to buy a new cts i will be able to get a leg up on the new buyers paying near msrp with my gms blush that would be good for me on residuals for a lease    be honest with you i think that caddy will have a winner if they are managed to keep the same price and add a few standard equipments like leather seat keyless entrystart and blue tooth with the new cts the base model has to start below 30k and the 36 at around 34k    i totally agree shades    rocky,rockylee
1767,December 2006,yes i meant the 08 cts    also lets not bring in any of those mydaddysmomssisterscousinisaxxemployeesoigetadiscount rebate into price discussion please the only fair way to compare price is msrp to me if a manufacture has to offer any incentive over 1 grand in order to move cars is a blow in its face,louiswei
1768,December 2006,to me if a manufacture has to offer any incentive over 1 grand in order to move cars is a blow in its face    i dont know of any manufactor outside of the ultra elites that sell like that     rocky,rockylee
1769,December 2006,i dont know of any manufactor outside of the ultra elites that sell like that     uh actually a lot of manufactures offer incentives close to 15 to 2 grands,louiswei
1770,December 2006,okay but wouldnt you classify a lower apr on interest a type of incentive  it sometimes can add up in thousands of dollars saved i also know many car manufactors that dont often give factory rebates but do compensate dealers who sell there vehicals at around invoice so whats the big difference  one strategy is up front and the other is hidden at the dealership confuse    rocky,rockylee
1771,December 2006,rearwheel drive is important to me for reasons that you may or may not care or know about    the subaru is supposed to blow everything else in the world out so long as you dont mind the noise  other issues sounds like the mazdapeed 6 may be in the same category my 3 son  his wife have a standard mazda 6  really enjoy it    bring me an asian rwd car with a manual transmission and room to put my bicycle in the back there  i think ive refined my problem statement    tell me the answer,cdnpinhead
1772,December 2006,i wasnt being pejorative it seems your preference for one option the paddle shifters which is important to you not to me bumped the price up 10k thats ridiculous on bmw part i agree but to me its not a reason to get the 350 over the 335 now because you like the 350 better and it comes with everything you want in the base model it is a reason to get the 350 over the 335 but i believe most people wind up with one or more buyers wind up with pricey options on their 350 just like i believe one or more 335 buyers will be very happy with the base model and vicenissan    most people would not base their final buying decision on paddle shifters imo,kdshapiro
1773,December 2006,not just the paddle shifter the 18 wheel is a must as well i wonder how much does it cost to get the 18 wheel alone since the sports package is only 1600    i agree with you yes my reason to choose lexus over bmw is because it comes with everything i want in the base model and i like its interior much more not because it has paddle shifter and bmw doesnt i also think that to base the final decision on paddle shifters is ridiculous as well however once i got it its hard to go back    also lets keep in mind that the difference is around 10k even if i foregone the paddle shifter and 18 wheel the difference is still well over 8k 1600 for the sports package i actually think thats a bargain i wish i can get the sports package on a lexus for that kind of price,louiswei
1774,December 2006,as always we will have to wait and see the ctsv will be coming out after both of those so its all about preferences,readerreader
1775,December 2006,i like manual transmissions and ive realized im not going to be happy if i get an automatic apparently i have the impossible dream for a car manual transmission entry luxury sedan eg four doors xm radio seat that flips down real wheel drive doesnt seem like it should be that hard but it is    i found out that i can convert bmw from sirius to xm with an adaptor and i can order a seat that flips down so i thought i was getting close but none of the dealerships around me have manuals to test drive i did test one 3 series manual coupe in another state and found that my elbow hit the arm rest every time i shifted it drove me crazy now my dealership is telling me that the arm rest is different if i order a sports package without the premiumeg that the sports package alone will solve the problem anyone know if there is any truth to that or if im being fed a line its really hard to buy a car if you cant test drive it    i keep getting such conflicting information i was also recently told by my local lexus dealership that i could order a 2007 lexus is manual with xmbut thats not what xm says or what the lexus webpages show    any thoughts appreciated and as far as recommendations ive ruled out acura and saabjust not happy with the way they handle thanks though,jensb
1776,December 2006,paddle shifter only comes with sports package and i dont like aftermarket rims on my car    time to learn stickhift if you are so hung up on shifting manually with those paddle shifters the difference in the 3 series is exactly the same as in the cts  automatic is a nice ride but stickshift is like you lit a firecracker in its pants paddle shifters are at best a halfbaked compromise    very much a jekylhyde type of experience for bothand me  oh i want mr hyde  never ever buying an automatic again,plekto
1777,December 2006,sorry plekto not a huge fan of manual tranny i know how to drive one and its fun to drive it once a while however as for my daily driver no thanks ill stick with auto also i am not and never would planning on track my car so for me i dont have the need to get one    i think i could foregone the paddle shifter and sports suspension if i can get the 18 wheel as a stand alone option however i am interesting to find out how much would that be since the whole sports package only cost 1600    at best the difference between my ideal lexus and my ideal bmw is still around 9k,louiswei
1778,December 2006,the guy loves talking about what might be after the cts arrives and fails to live up to his insane hype well hear about the 2011 model forever,blueguydotcom
1779,December 2006,seriouslyi would never ever put a chip or mod the engine on a 40k car    this aint no honda honda ya know    uh theres a chip already in every car tuners are simply reflashing the ecu or using a xede attached to the ecu no difference    dinan will offer chips as they do for all bmw products and the chips could easily boost power to 350 hp400 tq,blueguydotcom
1780,December 2006,you know you could just get the normal one without the sport package and add aftermarket 18ers for a lot less money    from lexus site      perforated leathertrimmed interior  power tiltandtelescopic steering column  lexus memory system to control power drivers and front passengers seats except lumbar outside mirrors and steering wheel standard on the bimmer  heated and ventilated front seats  aluminum sport pedals  aluminum doorsill scuff plates standard on the bimmer zsp  rainsensing intermittent windshield wipers with mist cycle standard on the bimmer  electrochromic autodimming outside mirrors with auto tiltdown in reverse standard on the bimmer  bixenon highintensity discharge hid headlamps standard on the bimmer and a must have  adaptive front lighting system afs standard on the bimmer and a must have  sporttuned suspension  18 x 80in alloy wheels with 22540ysubaru8 tires front 4 18 x 85in alloy wheels with 25540ysubaru8 tires rear 4standard on the bimmer zsp    so the sport package is more than just 18 inch wheels extra features xenon lights sad that this is extra and a different suspension    oh and thats 3700 yeah so suddenly the lexus is around 40k    hmm bmw with leather zsp comfort access tilt mirror bixenon swivels seat memory intermittent wipers is 38k via european delivery easy call for me the lexus is more expensive less fun to drive doesnt handle as well has a really bad automatic and costs a boatload more to keep up    btw good luck getting an lexus with a sport package p,blueguydotcom
1781,December 2006,gave him several must have criteria    18 wheels  comfort access  real leather  paddle shifter  no navi    by taking my request he went on his bmw web to search a car for me and came up with the following configuration    sports package  premium package  auto tranny  comfort access  metallic paint    whoa why do you need the premium package then thats an extra 1k you can get leather without it i just did you car a bmw sedan with leather metallic auto sport comfort and its 44795    thats 5k more than the similar lexus with sports package  which is impossible to order through lexus,blueguydotcom
1782,December 2006,i did test one 3 series manual coupe in another state and found that my elbow hit the arm rest every time i shifted    you must shift like my sister  she grabs the shifter with her thumb on top of the shifter and fingers along its shaft as if she were holding a joystick honestly there should never be a reason for your elbow to hit the recessed nearly flush armrest unless youre purposely pointing your elbow down during shifting    took me forever to find a manual 330 in 2003 as most dealers only had 325is in manual finally got my hands on a zhp and it was over 2006 was easier as manuals were available for testing everywhere check bimmerfest and you might find someone near you who will let you test drive his car    theres no difference between armrests    i keep getting such conflicting information i was also recently told by my local lexus dealership that i could order a 2007 lexus is manual with xmbut thats not what xm says or what the lexus webpages show    ask for exact details on an is order they dont let you actually order your car lexus builds cars and one might be made that fits your desires at bmw you order your car and get access to build info online to watch its progress my mulroney stick actually has my name on it,blueguydotcom
1783,December 2006,blue    dinan has no availability for the e90 yet for a reflashed chip    from what i could find the power gain per  is really not worth it for any of the dinan performance addons    regards  ow,circlew
1784,December 2006,dinan has no availability for the e90 yet for a reflashed chip    from what i could find the power gain per  is really not worth it for any of the dinan performance addons    first dinan hasnt chipped a turbo bmw yet    second dinan always offers chips for bmw cars    third even if dinan only bumps hptq 1515 thats a nice jump other tuners are easily seeing 6070 gains from first gen tuning    httpwwwe90postcomforumsshowthreadphpt36987,blueguydotcom
1785,December 2006,blue i know that you are a big fan of ed but thats just not an option for me    i guess to get the leather alone could be an option but the sales guy does have a point on not getting the premium package would hurt the resale value also i would also like to have some goodies that the premium package has to offer such as homelink and digital compass with the premium package the price comes to around 46k    personally i really dont care much about is sports package like i said i am no where near as an enthusiast and the stock suspension works for me i guess the bottom line is that i am really happy with the base lexus  18 wheel but would need many packages and options add on to the bimmer in order to be satisfied    oh well thats just me though    ps i agree that xenon not being standard on the is is crap i think any car over 30k should have xenon as standard feature even though its not a deal breaker for me but i would very much like to have one good thing that lexus now offers xenon as stand alone option on the 07 not bundle to any packages but that means we 06 owners were remain being screwed,louiswei
1786,December 2006,i like manual transmissions and ive realized im not going to be happy if i get an automatic apparently i have the impossible dream for a car manual transmission entry luxury sedan eg four doors xm radio seat that flips down real wheel drive    any thoughts appreciated    if youre willing to go awd you could get an audi its a gorgeous car and handles almost as well as a bimmer more luxurious as well,tlong
1787,December 2006,the saab 93 sport sedan and the 95 appear to be the safest in their respected classes    these crash tests show how far saab has come and also how much they are set apart from other manufacturers in unparalled safety    httpwwwsaabhistorycom20061222iihscrashtestsaab93sportsedan2004    httpwwwsaabhistorycom20061222iihs93sportsedancrashtest2003    httpwwwsaabhistorycom20061222iihs95crashtestfootage2002    there is even footage of the saab moose test that saab continues to do even today    httpwwwsaabhistorycom20061222saab900moosetestfootage1997    let me know what your thoughts are,saabhistory
1788,December 2006,id like to be frank    i think saab doesnt belong in this board period    again thats just me though,louiswei
1789,December 2006,not sure why ed is not an option guess you cant take one day off work youre that important the president can take weeks off but you cant take a monday off work    guess to get the leather alone could be an option but the sales guy does have a point on not getting the premium package would hurt the resale value    it wont hurt anything its a bmw not a lexus you will always find a buyer for a bmw  leatherette manual no sunroof theres always someone who wants it    also i would also like to have some goodies that the premium package has to offer such as homelink and digital compass    theres the answer you want 20 in parts and then complain those 20 in parts ran the cost of the car up 1200 you cant have it both ways you cant moan about the price or the resale yeah spend 1200 extra to sell it for 600 more 3 years later and then say you want really want the worthless options amongst the 1200 premium    personally i really dont care much about is sports package like i said i am no where near as an enthusiast and the stock suspension works for me i guess the bottom line is that i am really happy with the base lexus  18 wheel    why do you want 18s then if youre not an enthusiast and you dont drive it hard 16s or 17s would work better for you    lets be clear about what youre buying a stripped lexus no memory seats no auto wipers no bixenons yeah 07s have bixenons for a bargain price of 800 a base lexus is 37k,blueguydotcom
1790,December 2006,why do you say this this does not make any sense    the saab brand is as much as a part of the automotive world as any other brand is    i am surprised to hear something like this this is definitely a first,saabhistory
1791,December 2006,why i want 18 it looks better    yes i got a stripped lexus but luckily the stripped lexus offers almost everything that i wanted itll be perfect if it comes with xenon dont need memory seats or auto wipers most importantly the stripped is comes with comfort access and real leather i wouldnt mind to get a stripped bmw if its equipped like the is even though its 2k more    by the way i want everything in the premium package except bluetooth and heated seats so the want20butranupto1200 analogy doesnt make sense in my case come to think about it if i can get the 18 without sports package i could live without the paddle shifter but first i would like to find out how much is the stand alone 18 option cost if its not far from 1600 then there is no point of course itll hurt the resale value and theres always someone wants a lexus too they are just not your kind of people    ed sounds fun but its just not my cup of cake    i think we are all mistaken the point of discussion here in my original post i wasnt trying to compare 2 equalequipped lexus and bmw i was comparing my ideal lexus to my ideal bmw it turns out the lexus for me is base  18 but the ideal bmw requires premium  sports  auto  comfort access  metallic thats how i come up with the 10k difference,louiswei
1792,December 2006,i think that most folks around here are not inclined to think of saabs as entrylevel luxury performance sedans i know that after any number of test drives of 93s and 95s i certainly dont in spite if the fact that they can be had with three pedals under the dash    best regards  shipo,shipo
1793,December 2006,you must shift like my sister rlmfao    louiswei you say that ed isnt an option for you but you have what seems like a decent amount of free time to go and test drive the pontiac5 sport and bmw p plus wasted 2 salesmans precious time  2001 prelude type sh 2015 infiniti q40 awd 2017 honda honda touring awd,nyccarguy
1794,December 2006,yeah couldnt go anywhere during this holiday season because i am taking 2 weeks vacation in february to go to taiwan for the chinese new year celebration    air fare and lodging also cost money ya know    p,louiswei
1795,December 2006,i dont know why you would say this saab has an unparalleled record for safety performance progressive technologies    its not luxury bling like the in your face brands such as mercedes benz bmw or lexus but i think thats a good thing    its got all you need it just does not need to show it    the price certainly depicts entrylevel    i guess i am confused as to why you are saying this could you back this up,saabhistory

1798,December 2006,anybody whom knows saab history know that slogan is fos    thats like saying mitsubishi is born from jets too and rolls royce actually use turbine technology to create their cars    by the way since now honda builds airplanes too so all honda are born from jets    confuse,louiswei
1799,December 2006,i have no worrys because the 08 wont be a failure    rocky,rockylee
1800,December 2006,saabhistory    i believe saabs belong even though many as youve seen disagree saabs have as much performance if not more performance than a acura tl and many even believe that car belongs so i dont see how they could say saabs dont belong and i honestly believe that it has more to do with the antigm bias instead of the stats of the car    okay im prepared to get attacked sick    rocky,rockylee
1801,January 2007,allowing for a 15 driveline loss    using the 15 rule itll be interesting to find out other ellps dyno results as well maybe its not only the bmw whom underrated its engine    edit found it from wwwdravolkswagenmescom    all stock configuration with  besides the horsepower    2006 acura tl 22304 rwhp  262 hp before 15 loss official 258 hp  2007 bmw bmw 27589 rwhp  325 hp before 15 loss official 300 hp  2005 infiniti pontiac5 coupe 24220 rwhp  285 hp before 15 loss official 298 hp  2006 lexus lexus 2684 rwhp  316 hp before 15 loss official 306 hp,louiswei
1802,January 2007,just an fyi  one of the mags or maybe edmunds i really dont recall posted a 299xx on a dyno run you can search for it that is probably the exception rather than the norm but it does show the engine is a very capable one,kdshapiro
1803,January 2007,edmunds got well over 275 with their tests    httpwwwedmundscominsidelinedodrivesfulltestsarticleid11766910,blueguydotcom
1804,January 2007,it seems turbo cars typically vary quite a bit from the factory turbos are also affected more severely by temperatures    i dont doubt there is someone out there somewhere who finds their bmw to be 300hp as the factory specifies and maybe thats why bmw rated it that way just a theory  17 ford crew 27 67 coronet rt 14 towncountry limited 09 lsubaru hse 44car history and counting,qbrozen
1805,January 2007,i am just under an even 60 and i cannot sit in the is without my head hitting the roof liner unless i recline the seat a bit  which i do not want to do others i have spoken to have the same problem some of the fit issues have to do with torso length vs leg length i drove the is and liked much about it but it is just too small for menoticeably smaller inside than the tl g or 3 series the salesman actually called it a toy i dont agree with that but do think many wont buy it because they dont fit,pearl
1806,January 2007,the only complaint i have about the seating is that since i have really long torso the backseat behinds the drivers seat is pretty much useless however i had that problem with my previous honda too and i believe will have it in a g or bmw as well just in different degrees the only car in this class that will accomodate my seating position and at the same time to have a useful backseat could only be the tl cts might make the list too,louiswei
1807,January 2007,that is the main reason why i bought the tl back then the cts was my only other option when it came to room    rocky,rockylee
1808,January 2007,just got the february issue and here are quotes from the editors    sam mitani international editor now that i have a family things like rearseat space and ride quality are taken into greater consideration but the hotrod performance of the lexus lexus erased all my silly thoughts of comfort and civility the infiniti pontiac5 sport looks the best and the acura tl types was the most comfortable and spacious but it was the lexuss raw power delivery and sharp handling surprise that won me over now i need to come up with a good explanation to my wife and daughter who may not share my enthusiasm for the car    jim hall senior editor this japanese trio is very good but they still have little ways to go to unseat the sportssedan kings the bmw 3 series and cadillac cts the acura held up well against its new rivals and the infiniti has potential but its steering is too heavy and the engine lacks grunt of the three the lexus is my choice offering outstanding power a surprising sporty chassis and decent steering feel surprise  lets hope that lexus goes to bat for enthusiasts and adds a manual transmission for future models    jonathan elfalan assistant road test editor the pontiac5 sport is a blast to drive and best mimics the characteristics of a sports couple but lacks refinement in its suspension and gearbox however when it comes down to it the lexus is the most cohesive and complete package with a very compliant chassis and wellsorted transmissionnot to mention that its a missile cloaked by an unassuming exterior now if only i could order it with a manual gearbox    source rt feb 2007 issue,louiswei
1809,January 2007,for the discussion it doesnt matter if it is a chip for the 335 or some other bmw model so the idea of mootness is moot    you say you think you read where that bmw will install and honor the warranty on after market parts in its cars    honor the warranty whose warranty and who will pay for the repairs bmw factory warranty aftermarket part makers warranty the car dealerships service department warranty    honor the warranty well that is about as clear as mud    what do you think that means do you think the bmw factory warranty is going to pay for repair andor replacement of an aftermarket part exactly the same as if it was a genuine factory installed part that is do you think bmw will pay for the failed aftermarket part and for any consequential damage to genuine bmw parts of the car if caused by the failure of that aftermarket part    take a gander at that bimmerfest message board some owners there have actually had the pleasure of dealing with parts failures and warranty claims,joe131
1810,January 2007,hahaha    may affect    so what if it is straight from dinan the chip may or may not affect the cars warranty big deal that is hardly definitive right,joe131
1811,January 2007,so what if it is straight from dinan    exactly thats my point even dinan themselves cannot guarantee that if bmw will honor the warranty with the modification,louiswei
1812,January 2007,well of course dinan can not obligate bmw to warranty dinans chips  but the claim made earlier was that bmw would provide warranty coverage on dinans chips  that was the issue,joe131
1813,January 2007,279 hp compared to 275 thats a little less than one and a half percent difference  uhoh that big n tasty is going to cost you 101 instead of 99 now,joe131
1814,January 2007,if an authorized dinan bmw dealership sells and installs your dinan parts then youre covered period    time for my soapbox    i would point out that even the factory warranty on an unmodified car can be muddy in certain cases for example if your clutch burns out after only 15000 miles is it a defective tranny or did you destroy it with abuse this exact situation has happened to people on these very forums including myself 2 years ago with my old acura and the decision whether the dealership covered the repairs or not seems to be about 5050    the parts and service folks at my local bmw dealer all know me by first name  and ive never spent more than 50 there at a time im in there probably a couple times each month to buy a 6 oil filter 3 worth of 7mm screws or something like that thats it they always smile and say hello when i come in talk about e30s for a few minutes and then half the time they give me my parts for free if its not in stock they have even overnight drop shipped parts to my home  no charge    when i brought my acura in with a moaning clutch 2 years ago no questions were asked the acura dealer took care of me without hesitation other people have not been so lucky why imo your automobile is one of your biggest investments and like your accountant lawyer or bank branch manager you should have a personal relationship with the people who help you take care of it if youre an enthusiast and what dinan customer isnt to some extent you should want to be an insider with the dealership people who are in the know    youll never have a problem with warranty support dinan modified or bone stock if you do this,fedlawman
1815,January 2007,interesting to point out    lexus won the comparo in both price independent and price dependent standings consider that it is 5k more expensive than the tls and 6k more than the pontiac5s all similar equipped    this is one area which i dont really agree with the reviewers id consider pontiac5s the best buy among this group with price in consideration,louiswei
1816,January 2007,interesting  a reply to your own post not feeling too loved    ok  ill pat you on the back    you have a super car,ontop
1817,January 2007,nah just finish reading the article and didnt notice it when i was typing the first post since it took a while so i cant go back and edit the original i just think i should pointed it out for those whom dont have access to rt    oh btw none of the cars in this segment are super cars above average they all are super car nah    like i said the pontiac5s is definitely the best buy in this bunch if i am in the market right now for an ellps and must have sport suspension plus navigation then there is no brainer i would choose the g over is    that being said the bmw is still the king among this segment price independent of course cant wait to see a complete comparo later this year which includes the nonpermissible content removed 3 plus the bmw and all new cts    well at least someone has to make an effort from preventing this place turning into the hail to the bmw board right p,louiswei
1818,January 2007,so if you cant beat em join em confuse    sounds like you have a lil bit of buyers remorse blush,ggesq
1819,January 2007,you say if an authorized dinan bmw dealership sells and installs your dinan parts then youre covered period    but did you ever have a serious engine damage warranty claim with your dinan chipped bmw    i did not if you did not either it might be better to talk to or read of those who have    and standing on a soapbox does not necessarily lend credence to your speech it just makes you seem louder,joe131
1820,January 2007,so if you cant beat em join em    uhwhen did i ever join them if you have been following my posts in this board you can see that i have never ignore the fact that 3series is the benchmark of this segment i just think lexus suits my need better test drove the 330i at the time of my purchase and liked lexuss power better went to test the bmw over the holiday and loved the new twin turbo i6 and sharper handling however still cant get over its hefty price tag and imo ugly interior also with the ect power mode on the v6 in the lexus is very comparable to the 30 twin turbo    sounds like you have a lil bit of buyers remorse    be honest i really thought i would if i go test drive the bmw thats why it took me a while to hit my local bmw dealership however after the test drive see above i can say that i would still make the same decision this time around with lexus vs bmw    the only buyers remorse just a little p  i have is that i didnt opt for navi on my car oh well nothing a decent portable gps navigation unit couldnt fix ,louiswei
1821,January 2007,if your car is not within the car manufacturers factory warranty period dinan will repair or replace at its sole discretion any defective dinan component dinan will not accept responsibility for consequential effects or damage to any other component or system  httpwwwdinancarscanewlookhtmlwarrantyhtm    if your car is in the new car warranty period then dinan has to decide that its part was defective and caused the damage if dinan denies that and bmw believes it you may end up in court trying to collect from one or the other possibly losing at both claims    seems to me that a warranty is no guarantee of paid repairs,joe131
1822,January 2007,id take the lexus all day over the 335 maybe if im in a race everyday id reconsider  but im not the lexus has excellent excellent performance outstanding craftmanship beautiful interiorwhats not to like    as for the navigation newer portables will eclipse whats in the car now for a whole lot less money,jimmy81
1823,January 2007,if your car is in the new car warranty period then dinan has to decide that its part was defective    actually dinans warranty states the authorized dinan dealer will without charge for parts or labor repair or replace the defective dinan components as well as any original vehicle manufacturesubaru46s components that may have been directly affected by a dinan component using new or authorized remanufactured parts the decision to repair or replace said parts is at the sole discretion of dinan andor the original vehicle manufacturer     they dont get to decide whether theyre at fault or not  only whether to use new or repairedremanufactured parts when your car is repaired    if your car is not within the car manufacturers factory warranty period dinan will repair or replace at its sole discretion any defective dinan component    so if i install a dinan superdodge on my 20 yearold 193000 mile bmw and then the engine blows they wont buy me a new engine hmmm i wonder if my aftermarket camshafts crank pistons valves injectors chip maf throttle bodies headers shifter flywheel driveshaft differential axles wheels or exhaust are covered maybe someone should tell paul newman that the ford engines in his lolas are vulnerable    joe thank you for revealing the truth about these hideous aftermarket warranty loopholes we need more people like you to help protect us from ourselves,fedlawman
1824,January 2007,however after the test drive see above i can say that i would still make the same decision this time around with lexus vs bmw    see post 7429,ggesq
1825,January 2007,well like i said thatll be 4 years from now by that time ill have a new 3series new tl and new is for me to choose from itll be a brand new ball game    i am by no means loyal to lexus its just that this time around lexus has the product to suit me the best if there is one brand i am being loyal to thats hondaacura but as you can see i passed on the tl for lexus    the biggest throwback on the bmw for me is the interior if that didnt get improvement for the next gen then there is no way ill be paying for one i would probably still consider it and crossshop it like i did before but if i dont really like the interior dont really see myself getting one however if bmw brings back e46s interior then its a different story all together yes i know i am an interior nut it is as important to me as the sport suspension and manual tranny to blueguy p ,louiswei
1826,January 2007,yeah just got one for myself over the holidays and tried it on my drive from melbourne fl to atlanta it is a nice little toy to have,louiswei
1827,January 2007,i am looking at buyingthe new pontiac5 and am wondering why it would not be considered the best buy in this segment i can get a loaded pontiac5 for 40k that includes nav rear view camera upgraded stereo and all the other goodies what am i missing i have looked at the bmw and the lexus and i can not figure out why anyone would choose them over the pontiac5 i am not a race car driver and like performance and luxury while still having some room to carry passengers and luggage can someone please tell me what i am missing and why a similarily equiped bmw 335 for 50k is a better buy,dafreak1
1828,January 2007,the short answer is  it performs better    some folks would choose performance over options individual preferences is what makes the world go round  17 ford crew 27 67 coronet rt 14 towncountry limited 09 lsubaru hse 44car history and counting,qbrozen
1829,January 2007,it performs better in what manner from my understanding the pontiac5 outperformed andor held its own against the 335 i would like to own the 335 i just can not justify it it seems like you are paying for the name,dafreak1
1830,January 2007,to answer your question pontiac5 is definitely the best buy comparing to the hint key words similarly equipped bmw and lexus however not everyone choose the same feature as you do so if all i want is navi and willing to drop 40 big ones then id go for lexus over the g due to its better fit and finish and performance on the other hand if gadgetryfeatures is all i care about then yes the g is definitely a better choice    i got a question have you test drive all 3 cars i did i was surprised by the lack of power of the new vq and couldnt believe this engine is rated the same at horsepower output as the 2grfse as the new pontiac5 sports suspension is obviously softer than before so it sort of lost the cheaper 3series alternative title    so the bottom line is    the pontiac5 doesnt handles better than the bimmer doesnt outpower the bimmer and lexus and has an inferior interior than the lexus i think infiniti took the middle road this time around they are trying to do well in every area but not great in one or two particular    best buy for features and overall package yes class leader in any area no it all depends on what the buyer wants you cant really go wrong with any car in this class,louiswei
1831,January 2007,no offense but the cts has to be one of the ugliest cars on the road that alone keeps me from even looking at it that and it carries an american badge,dafreak1
1832,January 2007,you are comparing apples and oranges i own a 2004 tl 6speed w 23k miles last time in for service i got a test drive of the tls automatic no 6speed available    the tls automatic is not as quick as my tl 6speed it didnt feel quite as flat in corners or nimble in handling but the difference was nominal i dont know if on the tls they have a firmer sport suspension on the 6speed  they did on my 2004 along with brembo brakes    all of that said the tl and tls are extremely nice well balanced sporty family sedans i would heartily recommend one to friends looking for that blend of sport luxury features and value    but comparing a fwd tls to a bmw which is a true high performance rwd sport sedan is not a fair comparison certainly if the added performance of the bmw is not of value to you then the extra 10k is a waste of money but there is a difference between a well balanced sporty family sedan and a serious sports sedan the tltls is the former and the bmw is the latter,habitat1
1833,January 2007,the top 3 reasons why bmw owners are forced to defend their purchases are    1   2   3 ,kdshapiro
1834,January 2007,why would anyone be forced to defend anything    if you buy and drive what you like and are happy with your decision you should have absolutely no reason to feel a defense is in order  17 ford crew 27 67 coronet rt 14 towncountry limited 09 lsubaru hse 44car history and counting,qbrozen
1835,January 2007,okay heres what i get from your post    tltls well balanced sporty sedan  bmw serious sports sedan    so base on that how should we categorize the ellps segment if comparing tl to bmw is apples to oranges then one of them cant belong in this segment right my understanding is that every car listed on top of the page are comparable to each other in an apples to apples way yesno    maybe we need another place for serious sports sedan discussion regardless of luxury because my understanding of the ellps segment is blend of sport luxury features and value which is exactly your definition for acura tl,louiswei
1836,January 2007,why would anyone be forced to defend anything    because this is a public forum and there are a lot of people reading these posts if there are inaccurate statements toward any of these cars bmw included i think its everybodys responsibility to clear that up so someone thats here for information wouldnt be misled the owners know their own cars best so it is obvious for an lexus to defend the is and tl owner to defend tl as so on    i think we are all adults here and are mature enough to admit buyers remorse if there is one    classic example of how bmw owners defend their cars the handling is the best and itll beat any car on a track    classic example of how is owners defend their cars awesome acceleration 350 owners best interior in the class typical lexus qualityreliability    classic example of how pontiac5 owners defend their cars bmw replacement for much less of its price the best value in class    classic example of how tl owners defend their cars toyrich standard equipment although fwd but handles superbly also the best value in class    sounds mazdar,louiswei
1837,January 2007,sorry i guess im a bit too literal when you said defend their decision i didnt take that to mean defending a cars honor or stats i say those things about all of those cars yet i own none of them so i dont consider that defending my purchase decision  17 ford crew 27 67 coronet rt 14 towncountry limited 09 lsubaru hse 44car history and counting,qbrozen
1838,January 2007,so base on that how should we categorize the ellps segment if comparing tl to bmw is apples to oranges then one of them cant belong in this segment right    i was commenting on the previous posters analysis that the bmw cost 10k more than the tls as if there isnt a fundamental difference between these cars there is    does that mean they arent both ellps im not necessarily suggesting that but youve already admitted that  other than straight line accleeration  you dont really care about the p in performance thats fine but that shouldnt be extrapolated into some objective conclusion that one is a better value than the other becuase its cheaper when in fact it offers far less p a better value objective would be a car with similar or better attributes at a lower price a better choice subjective is what works for you or me    imo the tls and lexus are much more directly comparable than either of those are to the bmw but even thats imo and i know some that would claim the is shouldnt even be in this list because it cant seat 4 full size adults comfortably so everybody has their priorities i just think the term better value is being overused in this forum    ps in the early 1990s friends of ours both lawyers chose to buy a bigger house in a high end baltimore neighborhood for 425k instead of a smaller house in a high end dc neighborhood for 650k they justified it repeatedly as you get a better value in baltimore today their baltimore house is worth 800k and the one in dc would go for 2 million so which really was the better value,habitat1
1839,January 2007,did i mention value any where in my previous post let me check hmmnot exactly value only appeared when i was quoting from your previous post    thats not my point the point is you are saying that tls to bmw is not an apples to apples comparison but at the same time they are in the same class if we cant compare 2 cars from the same class as apples to apples then what else can we accomplish here    imo the tls and lexus are much more directly comparab    hondaing to your logic one is fwd and another is rwd end of comparison here on the other hand tls offers manual tranny but because its fwd so not comparable to the bimmer now my question is what exactly is tls role here maybe its time to remove all nonerwd and noneautomtic entries here and let bmw pontiac5 lexus and cts fight it out oh btw yeah because of the lack of power lets remove the lexus as well,louiswei
1840,January 2007,in my opinion handling is the only advantage the bmw has over the tl most important to me is reliability however the tl does handle very good has plenty of power and a lot more goodies that are standard hands down the tl is the much better value,frisconick
1841,January 2007,handling and gobs more power theres a power gulf of about 60 hp 320 hp to 260 hp    value wise the tl is great just as a mcdonalds value meal is consistently cheaper than a ruths chris lunch you get fed no matter what,blueguydotcom
1842,January 2007,i owned an 03 pontiac5 and currently own an 06 tl that i plan to trade in in the next few days for an 07 pontiac5 there is no comparison between these cars the pontiac5 is a different beast i feel like i went from a care free kid when driving the pontiac5 to a middle aged wuss whilst driving the tl i got caught up in the tl hub bub and the deal but in the end i made a bad mistake and bought a car that is uninspiring and bland i assume that is how some bmw owners feel about the pontiac5 as well and i respect that my two cents,dafreak1
1843,January 2007,i thought new tls had 286 hp and the 335 and 300 i could be wrong,frisconick
1844,January 2007,i almost bought a pontiac5 coupe so i do know what you guys are talking about i test drove the g 3 times,frisconick
1845,January 2007,hes base tl and dyno bmw hp values    yes hondaing to acura and bmw tls and bmw have 286 and 300 hp respectively,louiswei
1846,January 2007,he said tl not tls and the bmw makes more than 300 hp havent seen a dyno yet that shows less than 320 thats a major gulf,blueguydotcom
1847,January 2007,hondaing to your logic one is fwd and another is rwd end of comparison here    come on i seriously doubt that given your driving preferences you could personally tell the difference between fwd and rwd from behind the wheel you bought 18 tires on a nonsport suspensioned slushbox lexus because they were must haves from an aesthetic standpoint you are admittedly not a driving enthusiast the only time i find the tls fwd to be a detriment is in spirited driving but i would find the is slushbox a detriment all the time    i think the automatic tl and lexus are more comparable because both emphasize l more than p in terms of gadgets electronics and appointments and offer japnaese nofuss reliability    to clarify im not saying that any of these cars cant be compared to one another for features attirbutes and price but at least three straight posts following your response credit one car or another with being the better value as if that is an objective metric that everyone should be able to agree on its not thats my point and ill give up beating a dead horse if its still not clear,habitat1
1848,January 2007,an 03 pontiac5 to an 06 tl to an 07 pontiac5    and didnt i see where a 5k difference to jump to the bmw  which i think you indicated you would prefer  was too much of a stretch you might want to consider sticking out your purchases a bit longer so you can better afford what you really want,habitat1
1849,January 2007,if you compare the everincreasing bloat of these cars its clear that were seeing a revival of the old musclecar era bigger engines and bigger cars  and    the lexus is almost 3500lbs the 3 sereis is basically 3400 and change  hardly any different    so none of them qualify anymore as a serious sports sedan they all just weigh to much btw  the 325i from 1990 weighed in at barely more than 2800lbs to me it must be under 3000lbs have rwd and stickshift to qualify,plekto
1850,January 2007,blueguy    it waa right about the time when the lexus came out and all the 3 series owners were telling lexus supporters that hp doesnt matter whats the point  yeah thats great for straight line performance the is 350 blew the competition away when it first came out w the amount of raw power it offered and everyone chuckled at the is owners about straight line performance    guess what infiniti and bmw responded because they recognized the obvious hp threat from lexus    now your telling me that your gloating over the amount of hp the bmw has cmon if the bmw didnt come out when they did bmw owners would still be saying straight line performance and hp doesnt matter its how well the car handles and blah blah blah ill admit that the hp in that bmw is impressive and is class leading not literally its a great alterative the the e46 bmw    when the 4gtl comes out that hp difference should be closer    just my 02,ggesq
1851,January 2007,lets make this clearthe person you described above sounds like heshe will be really happy in a buick lasabre however that is not me    i am definitely not a driving enthusiast because 1 i dont track my car 2 dont drive like i stole it and 3 i enjoy the comfort my cars interior has to offer as well as its driving dynamics that being said it doesnt mean that i cant tell a different between fwd  rwd one doesnt need to push the car to the limits in order to notice a difference an average driver okay maybe a little above average can tell a fwdrwd from the first turn out of the parking lot    since you kept bringing out the 18 tire  nonesport suspension  automatic lets get it over with once for all    18 i like my car to look sharp maybe you dont care much as how your car looks but i do imo 18 looks better than 17 also have you seen any rwd is with the 17 wheels i doubt it because guess what they dont build it like that although the 17 is standard and 18 is option but almost every rwd is shipped to the southeast has 18 on them so far havent heard about the 18 causes problems on the is yet    nonesport suspension comparing to my old honda honda the is suspension is sport enough i really dont need a suspension thats any stiffer as i said before since i dont track my car dont drive like crazy and there are no mountain roads around me i just dont see the point to drop 4k on the relatively useless to me of course sport suspension    automatic manual is definitely more fun to drive i know this due to my experience with the manual 3000gt and boxters however as this is currently my only car i think automatic is more practical especially when i was tired from a days work and stuck in traffic i would rather just listen to music relax and not have to utilize my hand and feet that much when its time to purchase my second weekend fun car the current top choice is chevrolet z06 with manual transmission    bottom line i view the ellps as a fancier commuter box which is practical enough for everyday driving when times come and i am searching for some serious fun and sport ill be looking at someplace else,louiswei
1852,January 2007,are there any sports sedans these days that weight under 3k lbs    by the way a 1990 325i took nearly 8 seconds to hit 60 mph thats on par with many midsize suvs by todays standards not exactly what i would call sporting and yes i know youll point out the handling but handling alone does not performance make  17 ford crew 27 67 coronet rt 14 towncountry limited 09 lsubaru hse 44car history and counting,qbrozen
1853,January 2007,its not a stretch its just not worth it and its not 5k its 10k i do typically stick to my purchases longer but the tl in my mind it is a dog a dog i no longer want the pontiac5 seems to be the best fit for me whether i like the styling of the 335 coupe or not,dafreak1
1854,January 2007,well you obviously would compare the 1990bmw    the point is that 3500lbs is just too heavy    oh  3000lbs  the mazda seats 4 peopleits technically a 22 sports sedanyeah i know it has those wierd rear doors but rear doors they still are    it drives very nice now if they could figure out how to get 250hp out of the engine,plekto
1855,January 2007,thank you ggesq just what i was thinking when we were discussing how great bmw is on a dyno    there you go kdshapiro herere your top 2 330i purchasing justifications    1 hp doesnt matter whats the point  2 yeah thats great for straight line performance but 330i will blow everyone away on a track    oh and ill throw in the third    3 bmw interior is great for its functions,louiswei
1856,January 2007,agreed the cars are massive now,blueguydotcom
1857,January 2007,t waa right about the time when the lexus came out and all the 3 series owners were telling lexus supporters that hp doesnt matter whats the point  yeah thats great for straight line performance the is 350 blew the competition away when it first came out w the amount of raw power it offered and everyone chuckled at the is owners about straight line performance    having driven an lexus i can say straight it went like a bat out of hades but once you came to a corner you were consuzukid with lousy roadfeel a yachtlike suspension and poor chassis performance that still stands on a track the lexus would quickly fall to the e46 zhp 06 e90 zsp any pontiac5 and probably most tls and audis    guess what infiniti and bmw responded because they recognized the obvious hp threat from lexus    no they realized americans arent too bright we see a big hp number and think a car is good  hence the success of piggy cars like the 300c so bmw and infiniti offer onpaper hp comparable to an lexus but of course the driving dynamics of the two far outshine the is    now your telling me that your gloating over the amount of hp the bmw has cmon if the bmw didnt come out when they did bmw owners would still be saying straight line performance and hp doesnt matter its how well the car handles and blah blah blah ill admit that the hp in that bmw is impressive and is class leading not literally its a great alterative the the e46 bmw      we mention it because in a straightline the bmw takes the lexus then the first corners come uhoh it takes the corners faster than the lexus by the end of a track run with the same driver youd get times that are decidedly in favor of the bmw before youd win out because youd still take the twisties faster than the waffling is can handle essentially the cars the complete package no matter what lexus does to the is in terms of hp  like the silly isf  the car will still be saddled with poor steering poor roadfeel junky tranny and a lousy chassis,blueguydotcom

1860,January 2007,on a track the lexus would quickly fall to the e46 zhp 06 e90 zsp any pontiac5 and probably most tls and audis    lexus beats the tls and pontiac5s on steering brakes ride and handling in the recent rt comparo ill give you the same credit as to those editors so this is pretty much a tossup    so bmw and infiniti offer onpaper hp comparable to an lexus but of course the driving dynamics of the two far outshine the is    see above regarding the infiniti agree with bmw has better handling than is    like the silly isf  the car will still be saddled with poor steering poor roadfeel junky tranny and a lousy chassis    wow so you have driven the isf already last i heard that the isf will be introduced at naias next monday and be at the show rooms late this year if you had the privilege to test the isf then do tell if the isf is silly then i dont see how bmw c amg srs4 not being silly as well,louiswei

1864,January 2007,skobla  ed 2 year leases on 5 series cars check bimmerfest when bmw runs leases with inflated residuals mid 70s on 2 year leases and super low mfs less than a percent equivalent you end up with stupid cheap leases    consider ed is usually 85 of msrp and a 75 residual means youre only paying for 10 of the cars value figure 56k finally add in the 1k on the bmwcca rebate and youll see leases for under 400 hard to believe but people get them,blueguydotcom
1865,January 2007,i had a 2004 tl 6spd also liked the tls engine chunky gearbox action and great stereo disliked the onoff switch clutch uncommunicative steering which loaded up heavily and asymmetrically its tendency to wander around if not watched constantly its flatspotting std el42s    it just goes to show you that everyone can have different impressions and opinions of the same car on your positives i agree with you on the gearbox and free revving engine i am not that impressed with the stereo seems like it is clarity and power challenged    i used to have a 1998 audi and bought a 2005 tl auto unfortunately  wife doesnt like stick    i agree with a few of the posts the tl has been more reliable than the audi as of 36k miles proscons     tl very reliable   no rattles initially some started around 25k   standard michelin tires are fine i probably have about 510k more on them   stereo imho is overrated i had bose in the audi   ride is pleasantly firm but wallows in turns when bumps are present steering not precise enough   bluetooth wasnt a big consideration has turned into a fantastic plus   nav system is another big plus   handling not comparable to the audi i feel im driving in more of a luxochrysler than a sport sedan    in summary while i like the car it doesnt inspire a lot of passion im going to keep it for probably 100k and then move to a sportier sedan with a manual p,tlong

1867,January 2007,i do wonder why you took a soaking to get rid of your 2004 tl    not that much of a soaking  a trade but in that ballpark resale is good on the tl but any trade after 18  24 mos is hardly a winner though    mine is a 325i the tl has considerably more power but that differential was addressed somewhat when the revised sea criteria forced the tl down from 270 to 258 while it bumped the chevrolet up  heres to the wounded heart of good old chevrolet,nkeen

1876,January 2007,i believe dafreak stated he lives in chicago our traffic is plenty reason to stray away from the manual    no its not imo if you enjoy driving a ellps there is really no excuse to get it in an automatic if you are physically capable of driving a stick if the traffic is that bad and your daily commute that tedius imo you should get a bloody toyota save yourself a bundle and use your savings and tax credit to get a serious fun car like the honda s2000 for the weekends    we live in dc and until our 2005 acura neither my wife nor i ever owned an automatic combined ages of close to 100 my wife likes a manual not because she drives like danika patrick she just likes the feeling of direct control and no unexpected upshifts or downshifts the volvo v8 we also considered had an automatic with a mind of its own her first choice would have been the x5 30 6speed but it was too small we came out of a 1996 isuzu trooper 5speed which she put 80000 miles on in her opinion there is nothing about the acura which isnt light years better than the trooper except for the transmission    but hey its your money i would just find the idea of an ellps and an automatic for me to be a sure sign that i had gone bipolar and needed prozac fortunately so far no such inclinations,habitat1

1899,January 2007,55 lbs makes a big difference in roadfeelhandling imho i can feel far less than that in my car a 10 lbs container of cat food is noticeable in my trunk yes when i fill up with gas the car feels different    bull i am a strong promoter of lighter is better i think a 3300lb 350z is indeed a pig compared to a 2850 lb s2000 i think awd at a 100300lb disadvantage is not a good tradeoff in a sports car or sports sedan    but your claim that 50 lbs makes a big difference in the handling and road feel of a 3500 lb sport sedan is taking the point to the extreme not on any public roads and probably not on a track if it did the car couldnt even make it around a corner loaded with 4 passengers    as far as noticing 10 lbs in the trunk double bull unless you have that bag bouncing around in 8g slalom turns and hear it there isnt a human being on earth that could tell its there the fuel tank in my 911 holds 168 gallons  135  lbs i can tell the difference between full and empty but not between 916 and 58 crap ive lost 8 pounds since the holidays and looking to drop another 20 i hope to feel a lot better driving my 911 if i get get my 6pack back by spring but the car wont perform any differently how much does schumacher weigh anyways    congratulations on your recent engagement perhaps your post is attempted justification for you and your fiance to drive around naked but i dont really think you have science or engineering on your side    ps the lighter is better principle is one i fully agree with the issue imho however isnt that a 530i weighs 44 lbs more than a 330i its that a diminimus sized lexus sedan weighs over a quarter ton more than my 5 passenger 1995 nissan nissan 3500 lbs seems to be the new standard compared to 3000 not that long ago,habitat1

1901,January 2007,habitat my 330i feels totally the different the moment anything goes in it  especially the trunk humans in the car  well it just becomes outrageous how bad the car feels one 110 lbs passenger  my fiancee  and the the cars balance is totally different    and yes the weight in the trunk is moving around  slamming from side to side which will naturally exacerbate the problem a 20 lb bag of feline pine sliding back and forth on every cornerugh    the spongy suspension the silent interior the massive size the clunking hvac the grinding brakes the spotty comfort accessfeb of 2008 cant come soon enough for me,blueguydotcom
1902,January 2007,still funny  you at 145 your fiance at 110 and your 330i becomes outrageously bad    back when i had my s2000 i had it in for service and as it was being brought up to me a guy comes over and asks hows the suspension on yours fine i said and then he explained that his seemed to ride too low and would bottom out on his driveway i sized him up to be about 62 and 230 i commented that he shouldnt have any trouble sinse the passneger capacity of the car was 400 lbs then his wife comes around the corner and must have been 510 and about 250 i wanted to stick around to see how they both fit in the car  but decided against watching that train wreck    so i guess the only thing i could recommend for you two is to indeed drive naked even my gym clothes running shoes and ipod add 3 lbs to my weight you may not feel the difference in the 330i but it will make for more fun leisurely drives,habitat1

1937,January 2007,i think the old clk 982002 was based on the e class platform and didnt use the c class platform until after the new c class came out 01 or so    actually the first 1998 clk w208 was based on the 1994 cclass too the clk has always been based on the c the last eclassbased coupes were the 19881995 300cee320 coupes    m,merc1
1938,January 2007,isnt gas cheaper than california everywhere at least in the states,pat
1939,January 2007,you can get a clk in manual though they are hard to find on a dealers lot    my coworker has a clk320clk230 with the big engine in it and with manual its as quick as a porsche chevrolet as one too  seriously overkill for almost any driving that you could want to do,plekto
1940,January 2007,oh man i remember the 8485 supras i was  in love with that car i remember the wheels  looked so ffat on that car to me it was the  bomb back then,maximafan
1941,January 2007,pat i think gas is cheaper everywhere else besides california  ny a close 2nd    merc1 ive always loved the stunning good looks of the clk 430 especially with those 5 spoke amg wheels my mom had a 98 clk 320 blackblack with the sort of cheesy looking wheels that looked good on the black car my dad saw the car featured in autoweek in august of 97 and ran down the the dealership the next day a saturday after work to place his deposit hes not that type at all but was just in awe over the cars looks and had to have one  2001 prelude type sh 2015 infiniti q40 awd 2017 honda honda touring awd,nyccarguy
1942,January 2007,needless to say ive been a fan of the clk430 too i still think the previous generation looks better than the current car but of course the current clk350 clk550 and clk63 amg are vastly improved in all other areas    there is no manual option for any current model clk for the us market    m,merc1
1943,January 2007,a clk320 with a manual what year was that i dont remember the w208 ever being offered with a manual at least in the us    m,merc1
1944,January 2007,actually the first 1998 clk w208 was based on the 1994 cclass too the clk has always been based on the c the last eclassbased coupes were the 19881995 300cee320 coupes    k…maybe it was the suspension components…thought there was some connection to the e    wikipedia says the 147unique platform borrows from both the c and enot sure what that specifically means    i suppose it doesn146t really matter any clk is tops in my book,ivan_99
1945,January 2007,i believe that you are correct the clk was never offered here in north america with a manual transmission regardless of engine size my bet is that plekto is thinking of an slk which was initially launched with a slushbox only however after nearly getting myself fired from mbusa for my disparaging comments about the lack of a manual gearbox the folks in montvale did ultimately decide to put a third pedal in that car as it should have been from the very beginning     best regards  shipo,shipo
1946,January 2007,im with merc on this i am almost certain that the clk never came with a manual transmission    i did drive the slk 320 6speed in my sports car shopping period of mid 2005 are you sure thats not what your coworker has    ps quick as a porsche is a pretty broad statment the base boxster has a tough time beating 6 seconds in a 060 run the 911s has been times as low as 39 unfortunately that slk320 6speed i drove was closer to the base boxster and the slk55 forced you back to the automatic transmission,habitat1

1948,January 2007,however after nearly getting myself fired from mbusa for my disparaging comments about the lack of a manual gearbox the folks in montvale did ultimately decide to put a third pedal in that car as it should have been from the very beginning    where have i been that i didnt know you worked for mbusa confuse    ok mr renegade heres my wish list 6speed manuals in the following please slk55 sl5505565 e63 e320 bluetec id like to name more but im figuring youll be on the unemployment line long before you get through the above actually make the bluetec first as a sport version 6speed would be the most interesting mb id consider buying in the near future so i can keep my 911    ps i concede you beat me by a couple of seconds but dont extrapolate that to mean an automatic is faster than a manual,habitat1
1949,January 2007,hmmm i thought everybody around here knew that i used to work for mbusa blush    maybe you missed the following post from nearly two years ago     shipo mercedes benzmercedes benz eclass sedans 6085 3 feb 2005 209 pm    as you can see when i said after nearly getting myself fired what i really should have said is after nearly getting myself fired on the spot my stay of execution only lasted about three months the folks in stuttgart wanted me to stay on on their payroll however two months after the slk incident my wife gave birth to our second child and there was just no way i could spend the next several years flying back and forth to germany geez if theyd offered me that gig when i was single id have been all over it like shine on a polyester leisure suit p    best regards  shipo,shipo
1950,January 2007,shipo    thats a great story and worth reposting in the future of the manual transmission forum    i too wonder in other areas whether its conventional wisdon or just plain arrogance that perpetuates some bad business decisions one could conclude today that of course mercedes benz buyers want automatics because anyone who wants a stick has self selected out of their customer pool but if im not mistaken the 3series crushes the c class in sales and the bmw beats the e55 in resale value    a friend of mine bought one of the very first eclasses around 1988 and ordered it with a manual the dealer tried to forewarn him about resale he responded that hell just have to take it to a bmw dealer when he was ready to trade down the road p    take care,habitat1

1985,February 2007,lol id still to this day buy the tl over everything pontiac currently offers and thats coming from a gm guy    the pontiac isnt a ellps because of its badge if you put a different emblem like a luxury nameplate badge on it then i think it has enough credibility on interiorexterior  gadgets to be a ellps the pontiac has the highest quality interior to ever be installed in a pontiac car this is all good news from gm because it raises the bar another step higher for the comapany while many will argue the mercedes benz has more luxury which may be true a unbiased person would be blinde to not appreciate the pontiacs fit and finish for a car starting out at around 26k and will top out around 33k i do think some ellps buyers will cross shop the pontiac because it offers a lot of value the 2008 cadillac cts is a ellps no matter how you slice i should be shocked that a few wont acknowledge it as such but deep down im not a bit surprised surprise    rocky,rockylee
1986,February 2007,the interior color choice ruins it a bit btw that isnt production color as its been noted on this and other sites i respectfully disagree with your position on pontiacs interior the mercedes benz c class was surprisingly plain i guess ive always admired mercedes benz interiors and the plainess caught me off guard for a car costig that kind of money is all    rocky,rockylee
1987,February 2007,take a look at the power to weight and the actual performance considering the car has a v8 i found the numbers listed rather underwhelming,blueguydotcom
1988,February 2007,since when was 362 hp on regular gas underpowered     that is 62 more horsepower than your beloved bmw bmw bluedotguy i will acknowledge the bmw from a size and weight standpoint will out run the pontiac gt but once the holden commodore hsvpontiac version arrives that will all change as motor trend reported a 502 hp 70 ls7 v8 is in the works i suppose that also will be considered underpowered as well confuse    rocky,rockylee
1989,February 2007,362 out of a v8  underwhelmed considering the cars behemoth size its not gonna be an entry lux car its more of a nissan with a v8    no matter how much power its just too darn big too,blueguydotcom

1995,February 2007,nope wrong criteria    brand is all important  a manual transmission is not at all important to make the cut,joe131
1996,February 2007,060 in 66 is slow  well maybe    yeah it might be porky but its one of the safest cars you can own cdodgeped when compared to a bmw or is 350  its like a limo in size it only gets expensive when you add every option including awd its still is less than a fully loaded bmw or is 350    rocky,rockylee
1997,February 2007,yes 66 seconds is slow  even generic compacts like the volkswagen are faster than that this is 2007 not 2002 anything over 55 seconds seems a little last generation weve got the pontiac5 lexus and bmw pulling near to sub 5 seconds 60 sprints,blueguydotcom
1998,February 2007,okay fair enough    rocky,rockylee
1999,February 2007,weve got the pontiac5 lexus and bmw pulling near to sub 5 seconds 60 sprints    yet all three of those arent entrylevel  they belong in the regular or mainstream luxury performance car category  based upon price alone if nothing else,plekto
2000,February 2007,how do you figure average selling price of a car in 2007 is 30k so therefore isnt 40k or so entry level luxury,blueguydotcom
2001,February 2007,that was my point about the defining first post being five years old i agree with you and i believe at this point going beyond 40k to some degree is warranted    in any case those vehicles are definitely staples of this discussion,pat
2002,February 2007,the kial pricepoint for an entrylevel car like this should be exactly the average selling price or 30k     the is 350 no stickshift gone if lexus added manual back for 2008 which given the upcoming cts they might id gladly welcome it back theres zero point in having 300hp in a smaller car like this and castrating it with a less than great automatic     the pontiac5 sport has manual and is right at 33k or so it fits this discussion its also nicely equipped as is  you dont need 6k in options to make it a nice car  cars direct target price 32950     the bmw isnt bmw entrylevel offering in this category so it fails based upon that criteria  carsdirect price 38560  this is for one with vinyl seats and not even the upgraded suspension that youd want  no  need to make it stand out from the competition    the ford needs to be on least expensive luxury performance sedans  and 40k isnt being frugal  or sometihng that an average firsttime buyer in this segment really wants to pay,plekto
2003,February 2007,plekto those cars are part of this discussion and that is not going to change if you dont want to talk about them thats fine just ignore them,pat
2004,February 2007,easily top out over 40 without trying until recently the bottom of the line infiniti had cloth the germans allow you to option out the vehicle as you want the 3 series is the bottom of the line of bmw lineup add one option to the lexus and the price jumps by 7k this forum is not the frugal shopping section of edmunds    a first time buyer who wants a more sporty 2007 vehicle than a family sedan but doesnt want to pay over 30k out the door is out of luck in this segment,kdshapiro
2005,February 2007,the original post itself stipulated that a manual transmission as nonnegotiable and it still is lexus needs to bring a manual option back because to people who dominate this segment its not even close to the real thing without it    as for the bmw the 330 is bmw entrylevel option hondaing to them if you start letting in upperlevel offerings of simmilar cars well then we might as well put the ctsv or the volvor in as well    ps while 30k may be hard to do 30k or so for a base price before options is very much the goal of many buyers ie  theyll squeeze up to 35k or so but take the bmw  you can easily bloat it up to 45k or more which is just not in the same pricerange,plekto
2006,February 2007,the topic has been welldefined for quite some time i guess there was a point where posters lost sight of the stick being a requirement while i personally prefer a stick as do many here there is some logic in letting it go as an absolute requirement as manual trannies become harder to find and as fewer and fewer folks unfortunately demand it    the ctsv and volvor are clearly overkill for this particular connissantion    i think it would be a good thing if we talked about the cars listed at the top of this page and stop worrying about what should or should not be included in this discussion that has done just fine for a very long time within its defined yet reasonably elastic given what has changed over time padodgeeters    it would be great if anyone who wants to change the topic goes ahead and fires up another we can never have too many places to debate these vehicles eh    edit in response to your edit as ive said a five year old post defining the pricepoint needs to be taken with several inflated grains of salt there is no reason to hold on to a five year old 40k ceiling,pat
2007,February 2007,all of the cars only the audi might allow you get out the door for 30k face it this is a speciality segment prices are not like the midsize family sedan segment    why dont you start your own discussion with the makes models and price of your choice this way you can exclude the upper echelon of the bottom rung,kdshapiro
2008,February 2007,i dont see why 40k isnt just as fair a ceiling as it used to be it keeps you firmly in entrylevel territory and is exactly one notch above the typical spongy boxesrental fleet fodder    the pontiac5 sedan the cts the volvo and 330i and a slew of others arent even 35k and are fine examples of this type of car a couple of them like the cts start at under 30k 40k is still more than enough to buy a few options and get it out the door imo    most people here want to raise that limit for one and only one reason the bmw but thats as unfair as the lexus is because the lexus is clearly what lexus is offering as their entrylevel sports sedan    and the 330i isnt a halfbad car either make no mistake about it it runs neck and neck with many of the others,plekto
2009,February 2007,with options almost every vehicle goes above 40k so you are in favor of eliminating the vehicle if it can be optioned out over 40k or are you just trying to twist the argument a bit the base price of every vehicle listed is below 40k and can be optioned to over 40k    please stop talking about the 330 you cannot buy a 2007 330 sedan or coupe the bmw leaves em in the dust,kdshapiro
2010,February 2007,i read the date on post 1 when i copied the beginning criteria to the recent post and it didnt register about cost increase i should have realized it has changed    i used an inflation calculator and the 30000 and 40000 went to 33333 and 45000 approx thats about 2 per year  2015 chevrolet 2lt 2014 chevrolet 2lt 2008 chevrolet 2lt,imidazol97

2029,February 2007,they stock both but wed look at the audi essentially fwd only as the 32 is way overpriced its far more space efficient than the cdodgeped audi and reasonably priced for what it is    hard to find compact entry lux cars nowadays even the 3 series is a midsize now,blueguydotcom
2030,February 2007,pontiac5 neither of us liked the 07 when we drove it at thanksgiving extremely cdodgeped interior and car felt heavy and disconnected from the road i prefer the last gen car more    i enjoy seeing everyone elses opinion of these cars and how they differ from person to person    ive driven the tl and agree with your conclusions  i drove the pontiac5x two days ago and i had a completely different opinion from yours    i feel the cars handles incredibly well and rivals comes very close to the feel of a 3series  there was also no front end dive when slamming on the brakes and no heavy plowing in corners like the tl    good luck finding a final decision,scottm123
2031,February 2007,you could always go with a roadster you know p    the sad fast is that anything fwd will feel sluggish and dead compared to a rwd setup because the steering is by definition going to have torque and weight on it bogging it down    and 3500lbs kills anything right there as well  it starts to feel like a gm or ford in that its good in a straight line but lacks the tossability of say an old bmw 2002 which is probably the best example of a sports sedan ever made  pure and simple and a blast to drive    but two cars she should try are    the older lexus i has a great balance of power versus weight compared to the tooslow lexus and the silly priced lexus its the only japanese car i ever drove that felt like a european one but then they depowered the base model and made both cars so much more heavy ack    the other is a mazda with leather its not too bad as far as feeling a bit luxurious but its light quick and fast it feels a lot like well like you took a pontiac5 and dropped 500 pounds of deadweight because the mazda weighs 3000lbs yeah it kind of is exactly like that    plus if she likes stick its even better    imo the mazda handles better than even a 3 series herehsy i know but the thing is that its roughly 300lbs lighter and hp isnt everything id take one over the bmw anyday  the bmw is definately better but dang what a pricetag the lexus at nearly 3600lbs is well yeah it bludgeons its way through corners like a 5 series or mercedes benz not bad mind you but not light either    httpwwwedmundscomnew2007bmw3series100814243specshtml  httpwwwedmundscomnew2007mazdamazda100793743specshtml  do a side by side comparisonmake two thin and tall windows     mazda is a bit shorter less wide weighs 300lbs less plus a few inches shorter wheelbase bit over a 1 ft smaller turning circle same hp230 vs 232 of note is how the rear seats are very close in size to each other if bmw thinks you can actually fit a 5th person in the center rear seat    httpwwwedmundscomnew2007infinitipontiac5100822701specshtml  yes it is almost 500 lbs heavier weight is poison in curves considering that an nissan is 3000lbs i just dont know why these cars are so darn heavy,plekto

2033,February 2007,thats why the choices are limited acura is small and id hoped shed like it no such luck audi is one of the few small near lux cars with power nice interior space and decent roadfeelhandling    the mazda has great handlinggood power but its got no interior space  especially for a baby seat same interior problems with the is evo is an economy car and feels it same with the subaru    really if the audi gets shot down shes gotta reexamine her priorities shes going to have to give up something power handling space small size luxury hopefulyl shell pick luxury as then that opens the mazdaudi to us    fwiw those acuras look pretty nice,blueguydotcom
2034,February 2007,the mazda doesnt have a center rear position but its plenty big enough for a baby seat in the reartwo same as the 3 series the interior space is virtually identical to the 3 series    id let her drive it but if she needs more space than a 3 series shes looking at midsize cars theres no way shes coming out ahead in that case ie  might as well try to fit a child seat in a smaller car than suffer with a boat    there is another option though  the lexus sportcross this is a wagon version of the is and as such has more rear roomthough its exactly the same it feels larger  like the volvo 240s did for instance it also could be had with stickshift making it a solid performer    me unless you have a baby now the reality is that a booster seat or even most fullsize baby seats will fit in the rear of a mazda shoot i fit a fullsize one in a fordrear pasenger seat though there was only about 1 inch if clearance,plekto

2038,February 2007,the mazda doesnt have a center rear position but its plenty big enough for a baby seat in the reartwo same as the 3 series the interior space is virtually identical to the 3 series    you can sit a carseat dead center in an e46 and easily in an e90 ive done it with my e46 and e90 and my broinlaws been doing it for 4 years with his e46 plenty of room in an e46 and expansive in the massive e90 the e90s freaking huge inside and out      there is another option though  the lexus sportcross    1 used  will only by new unless its wholly unavoidable  2 far more cdodgeped than an e46 and e90  i couldnt sit in the back of an lexus  3 drives like a slothful wagon  zero power    ive been in the mazda and its cdodgeped in the front and impossible for me to get in back flipside ive ridden comfortably in the back of the e46e90 getting a car seat in the back of one would be evil and turn the car into a 3 passenger    kd i know the acuras engine sucks gas nice small package though if she were serious about suvs wed be looking x3 via ed maybe mazda but thats where the options end,blueguydotcom
2039,February 2007,3 series midsized compared to what  it is not very big inside especially the back are you referring to epa volume ratings  epa says bmw is a compact with 9312 passcargo space in cuft    my point was that it apears as if he wants a car for his wife that doesnt exist she wants midsize space and subcompact handling not going to happen without a huge gimmie somewhere and the child seat seems like an obvious first place to start afterall the difference between the rear passenger and rear center isnt that much in terms of safety and there are dozens of makes of child seats    and yes the mazda can fit a child seat in the rear the seats are very low i felt as comportable in the rear as most compact cars in the front think of it as a car with 4 bucket seats    as for the space its like the porsche 928 22 so the rear takes a hit on paper because theres no center at all  its all one big driveshaft tunnel and center consolewhich is awesome to use as a passenger btw id venture it loses about 1520 cubic ft right there but since most small cars dont use that center rear area in actual usechild seat aside which makes the rear good for nobody else its like you took the 15 cubic ft of the least useable space in the car and got rid of it    when i get in the rear seat of a car i sit behind the passenger if possible then on the drivers side middle is only if i have no choice at all    its small but look at what his wife wants she wants a 3 series but with a minivans cargo space by the sound of it    if she goes small the truth is that the rear will be small  but since only small kids will go back there its not a huge deal is it id concentrate on trying any and all cars first  actually drive them all then worry about if a seat can be wedged in the rear or not,plekto

2044,March 2007,just curious but does anyone over 6 feet tall and 180 lbs find the bmw 3 series to be spacious and comfortable id love to hear from that contingent what they think ive driven and been a passenger in several of my friends models over the years and ive always felt cdodgeped and miserable my friends that are a similar size to me have felt the same way im 6 1 and 200 lbs to me i have to be comfortable in a car to qualify it as something id drive every day which is why id never drive one of those or a mb c or audi audi or volvo volvo every day those models are just way wrong for me its hard to notice or appreciate the chassis when im struggling to find a comfortable spot in the drivers seat,hauss
2045,March 2007,have you ever thought that maybe just maybe bmw is gouging a tad for that image i mean theres just no way a porsche suv is worth what they charge either yet they seem to have no problem jacking up the price because of that little logo on the hood    the current cts is already better than the 525i so somethings just not right considering the price difference alone    trust me the 2008 cts will be better than the 5 series for a lot less money shoot the 5 and 7 series arent as good as some of the japanese competitors either the 3  yeah its a rocket and worth the money but the 5 and 7 need some serious updating and vision because the competition is coming for them with both all blazing    2007 cts 36l 66 seconds 150 quarter mile  1993 porsche 968 66 seconds 149 quarter mile  2007 525i 73 seconds 167 quarter mile  2007 530i 66 seconds 147 quarter mile    bmw got very little breathing room in 2008 by the looks of it,plekto
2046,March 2007,bmw got very little breathing room in 2008 by the looks of it    by the looks of it your postings of 060 and quarter mile times shows that youve got very little clue as to what driving dynamics are all about and why bmw has little to worry about from gm and if you are simply trying to win stop light drag races you can do a boatload better than a cts which depreciates to half its value in about the time it takes to complete that quarter mile p    ps    porsche cayenne s 64 seconds 146 quarter mile p  porsche cayenne turbo 49 seconds 132 quarter mile p p,habitat1

2049,March 2007,did i miss something    since when did the bmw 5 become a member of the ellps class has it somehow fallen out of favor as an lps member    or somehow has the rumor and speculation about the new cts allowed it to join the lps class before it is even reviewed    if were going to talk about wheelbase cubic this thats and the other thing why isnt there mention of similarly sized cars from hyundai that spanky top o the line model is after all comparable to a bmw 7 in size it says so in all the adverts confuse    spent wheel time again this weekend in a 2007 chrysler awd limited lovely car great msrp considering it has a lot if not almost all the amenities that come in the ellps andor lps class    yet i get out of a 2007 300 with 1000 miles on the od into a 2005 audi audi with 30000 miles on it and the audi feels newer tighter more controlled refined smooth etc the 300 seems somehow looser not quite as precise in its steering a little bit unrefined and floaty at speeds over 65 but with a nice long wheelbase good leather a decent stereo with sirius radio and power pedals even  what a lot of car for the money heck it has esp and some fine mercedes benz underwear upgraded 18 wheels and tires round out the package as do easily modulated and smooth four corner disk brakes    for the money apparently nothing even comes close  but for pitys sake it isnt in the same class as the other lps cars or even some of these ellps cars    the current cts also a car that ive driven extensively is very competent and nearly as tight as the real lps cars but to keep comparing cars based soley on wheelbase or 060 times or cubic hectares per fortnight seems to me to miss the point    shipo the question stands did the 5 series somehow fall from grace could the new cts not even out yet already be the newest lps confuse,markcincinnati

2051,March 2007,no worries mark i was just responding to some marginally accurate statements regarding the acceleration of the current and very soon to be discontinued 525i and 530i    as far as i know the 5series is still and will continue to be one of the benchmark holders of the lps class of cars    oh and the cts even with the impending new model i trust it will continue to be an alsoran in the ellps category p    best regards  shipo,shipo
2052,March 2007,to elaborate on the caddy representing this segment the true test of even staying on the list in this forum is apparently more appropriate    as usual this us manufacturer is off the mark because the cts tries to compete with too many models in different segments i cant expect anything unique coming from the catera family line hopefully they kill it off soon    it is up to the host of course to decide that for this forum    regards  ow,circlew

2056,March 2007,based on your posts i would assume you are an avid bmw fan first of all the current cts and many other rwd vehicles is very close to the 5 in terms of handling especially if youre talking about the v i see that your perceptions of cadillac are stuck somewhere in the 1990s but most of the press and those who follow the industry realize cadillac is capable of building sporty rwd sedans if you think the current or next cts will be an also ran than you dont know much about the car at all    the 535 better be fast when you consider how much it costs sure it will be fastest in class but how much will you pay to get that extra 3secs in the quarter mile,1487
2057,March 2007,i cant expect anything unique coming from the catera family line hopefully they kill it off soon     a new cts is coming out in august with a 300hp di 36 v6 awd and 6 speed auto the car sold well so your contention that the car was off the mark is somewhat baseless the cts didnt outsell cars like the 3 series because it only has two three engines and one body style considering the lack of depth in its model lineup the car did well and it increased in sales from 2002 through 2005 topping out at close to 60k units i believe,1487
2058,March 2007,equal success    volume however is no indicator of greatness lexus sells a whole lot of the es personally id rather shove my head up a dead goats butt than be stuck in an es    cts is a crossover imo it prices against a 3 but sizes against a 5 way too big for my tastes as has become the 3    when we were talking e39 especially 2003 the 5 was worth taking along the extra bulk imo if for nothing else than just to look at,wale_bate1

2064,March 2007,1 sorry but i would rank the opinion of various auto magazines over yours since most agree that the cts is a capable rwd sports sedan i think at this point its pretty much an accepted fact if you chose to disregard this fact based on your high speed test drive so be it    2 the cts has a sports package or model just like bmw and thus your test drive experience may have been affected by what you drove since you apparently dont like cadillacs i doubt this really mattered to you but i thought i would make the point    3 the current cts was only considered an also ran once all of its competitors were revamped it wasnt an also ran compared to the last gen pontiac5 is 3 series audi or 5 series the new car has impressed all the journalists that have seen it and most cant wait to test it this summer also ran isnt even a consideration    i can tell by your comments that you are unwilling to give credit where its due to 3 or 5 series competitors so i wont pretend facts will change your position if you honeslty believe that the lexus and cts arent even in the same ballpark with the bmw models than you are not being realistic    series sorry the cts is sorely lacking     hondaing to you but not to those who own or have test driven the car over the last 5 years in 2004 it beat 6 other luxury sedans in a rt test but hey what do they know if you said it stinks than it must be so,1487

2073,March 2007,joe    save your breath  i dont put much credibility in any of the true cost to own lists not edmunds intellichoice kiplingers or others i think they try to be as accurate as they can but they are at best based upon a lot of hypotheticals that dont match my own experience i have always paid cash for all my cars has kept me from ever spending beyond my comfort level depreciation is a factor i consider if i think there is a chance ill selltrade the car in less than 57 years    from kelly blue book the trade in value for 2004 models of the acura tl 6speed w nav and the cts 5speed w nav 30000 miles each and excellent condition    acura tl 23875 vs current msrp of 36125  12250 loss vs new msrp  cadillac cts 18625 vs current msrp of 41180  22555 loss vs new msrp    everything on the tl other than nav is standard so its hard to be sure im correctly optioning the cts but at a minimum it appears the difference in msrp is 5000 without all the standard features offered by acura    the true cost of depreciation by my calcs shows the tl 10000 ahead of the cts those are real numbers that are from real kbb trade in values today you ask the edmunds host and others how they came up with their figures it is a mystery to me    ps i suspect youll counter that gm might give me a bigger discount on the cts than i could get from acura on the tl but i managed to negotiate a 10000 discount on a brand new 2005 porsche 911s from a baltimore dealer when the best i could do in the dc area was about 1500 off i would rather work hard to get a decentgood discount on a great car than get a great discount on a imo ugly lower quality car    pps my acura dealer wants to buy back my tl for cash at slightly more than kbb trade in value it is a highly desireable car in the used car market try finding a cadillac dealer that would do that with a 2004 cts  not in a million years at least in our area,habitat1
2074,March 2007,shipo    i agree completelyafter the ls which i owned lincoln is done with performance perhaps in the future when they merge and reinvent the brand    lincoln is done with hot rod status as far as im concerned my pappy says son your gonna drive me to  the end    regards  ow,circlew
2075,March 2007,i would rather work hard to get a decentgood discount on a great car than get a great discount on a imo ugly lower quality car    agree 100 say the cts is 38k out the door lets go with a bmw sedan at 44000 i think the 6k is not only justified for the return but since you can get the bimmer for a lot less on ed the difference would be halved and the return is golden at that point in comparison to the class of vehicle you get for the added  but i can never see someone crossshopping bmw vs caddy how odd since this rarely happens anyway the point is moot more likely cts vs lincoln    regards  ow,circlew
2076,March 2007,cts inferior to c class i think not the c class is the most inferior car in the segment again how is the cts or any other car in the class remotely comparable to the audi youre out in left field with that one the audi is based on a decades old chassis and it has the lowest output of all the v6s in the class gimme a break man    cts is outrageously overpriced compared to a 3 series you are really out there with that one i dont know how you managed to get an expensive 3 series for so cheap but that does not reflect the sticker price how can you make price comparisons based on price paid we can only go by msrps because they are consistent across the board    even if the caddy had been 5k cheaper than my car it would have been outrageously overpriced    that pretty much sums up your form of logic i dont see how this statement can even be made with a straight face,chavis10
2077,March 2007,i dont know what you people count as sport or luxury but any premium brand base model vehicle with no options is about the dumbest buy you can make thats a true sign of buying into the brand more than buying into the particular car as for the audi i would never drive the base model with no luxury features that would be a joke i dont know what audi youre talking about but the entire dash board is one solid hard plastic mold does it seem well assembled sure so what cts at least has soft plastic grain are you saying what makes a car speak luxury and sporty are nice fit and finish and complicated audioclimate controls if thats the case you could consider a bunch of cars luxury my point is i dont consider a souped up volkswagen volkswagen hatchback that weighs 3600 lbs and luxury car sorry    ps one of the cars in my garage is a mazdaudi for commuter duty it aint all its cracked up to be and has had numerous issues with brakes rears completely shot after a 15 years 500 repair under warranty creaking and rattling terrible fuel economy averaging 18mpg overall with 27k mi rough idling tranny shift shock emissions equipment repair and a scratch prone interior the press and reviews dont mean jack to me because they worship this little annoying car,chavis10
2078,March 2007,intellichoice figures in my previous post were for 2007 cars not 2004 they are best estimations of what an average owner can reasonably expect not numbers based on your own personal cars and your one person experience i already told you that  msrps on the 07s dont matter because intellichoice starts by giving the shopper a reasonable target purchase price not one that requires them to drive to your baltimore dealer or one that might for some reason sell a car with a discount six or seven times that offered by another dealer in the case of ctstls the target prices were cts 31302 and tlss 36504  the five year ownership costs are averages for average owners not supermen like you who achieve special deals on price insurance repair costs financing resale fuel maintenance etc  but i agree with you if your idea is that a person should not necessarily seek a purchase price or resale price that some guide says is average  i trust you for your own opinion of what your own experiences are with your own cars in your own mind fair enough  but for a more realistic comparison guide as to what average owners can expect from any of hundreds of cars ill trust intellichoice or edmunds or kelley etc even if their numbers dont end up exactly matching mine after i buy own and resell a car my guess is that their rankings of one car against the others would still place them in about the same order in cost of ownership as id have realized had i owned several hundred of the cars at the same time  guides are useful as guides you are not meant to copy the numbers from them into your diary expecting them to match your personal experiences,joe131

2088,March 2007,chavis10 says the c class is the most inferior car in the segment    i just had to chime in here i bought a new car 11 months ago and went with the mb c280 i believe it really depends on what one is looking for in a car i know that all the pundits seem to toss the cclass out as just not cutting it but i compared to the bmw 3series and the cts mine is an 06 not an 07 i have to say i was impressed with the cts in that it turns on a dime is responsive has good output i tested the 28 litesubaru10 hp version i went with the c280 though for a few reasons    first i wanted a car with awd given i live in a snow and ice area    second i wanted a car with great suspension tuning with all the  potholes around here    third i wanted a narrow car all of them are in this class and the cclass was a couple of inches narrower than the cts or the bmw i have a small garage and live in an urban area with tight spots    so my criteria could be a little different than most but in an area where there arent huge differences between these or the pontiac5 imo its the little things that are important to different people that vary from buyer to buyer,dfc3

2143,March 2007,there is only one domestic luxury manufacturer and that is cadillac they consistently rank higher than bmw and mb in dealer satisfaction build quality has been there for many years even going back to the fwd sts of last decade any visit to an autoshow or dealership will confirm this the sts and cts are more than capable of matching the e 5 3 and c class as well as audis in performance of course the cts is old now so its underpowered compared to the bmw but that will soon change the new cts will most definitely be as good or better than the new c350 and audi but no match for the smaller lighter 335 well i shouldnt say no match i should say the 3 series will be faster and more chevrolet    i have heard little that suggests that bmwmbaudi dealers can match lexus or cadillac in customer service if you know of anything that states otherwise let me know    prestige factor is up to the individual most people that post here would rather have a 328 than an stsv because any bmw is more prestigous than any caddy in some minds not in mine i dont find anything prestigous about a car that is ubiquitous no matter how good in handles the fact that i see 15 3 series models a day means that its almost like seeing toyota and honda the badge alone isnt going to make me want the car,1487
2144,March 2007,cadillac trails bmw in handling and resale value it trails mb in resale value only and it trails audi in nothing that i can think of right now some people are willing to endure less than hyundai service and high pricing to get a small edge in handling or prestige factor but others arent my thinking is nothing a bmw is capable of is ever going to be explored on public roads and i dont race my car so its pointless to pay more for a car that is equal to other models up to 810ths and is only superior at the limit,1487
2145,March 2007,i have heard little that suggests that bmwmbaudi dealers can match lexus or cadillac in customer service if you know of anything that states otherwise let me know    ive only seen firsthand one dealer network try lexus the caddy dealer in san diego laughed at me for wanting a manual not exactly good customer service mb of san diego also laughed outright when i requested a manual c class bmw dealers jump through hoops to sell but dont care about retaining customers fixing problems or in any way assisting people theyre as worthless as common americanjapanese dealers    prestige factor is up to the individual most people that post here would rather have a 328 than an stsv because any bmw is more prestigous than any caddy in some minds    any nonamerican car is better prestige is not a factor and never will be as luxury nameplates are meaningless marketing    the badge alone isnt going to make me want the car    true that its all in the drive,blueguydotcom
2146,March 2007,true that its all in the drive    bingo,wale_bate1
2147,March 2007,my thinking is nothing a bmw is capable of is ever going to be explored on public roads    honestly where do you drive that you cant hang the car out ever reminds me of trips to the midwest and south  miles and miles of nothing but flat land id go buggy without mountains hills the ocean etc hell just driving home last night from la we had a great time in my fiancees audi  the roads were open the night was clear she was having a blast toying with her cars power and handling on every corner dip twist turn we hit some backroads for kicks at around 11 and just played until near midnight    if you cant exercise the car then whats the point of getting any ellps you dont need the p just stick with the l part,blueguydotcom
2148,March 2007,divergence in the performance hypotheses    who says you have to push a cars limits to experience evidence of a superior driving set up hell just puttering around town the difference between a great driving package and a marshmallow is painfully obvious imo    to bgs point though if you dont feel the difference and intend to use the fun occasionally why buy it,wale_bate1
2149,March 2007,mb of san diego also laughed outright when i requested a manual c class    call the dealer in arcadia canear pasadena they are very willing to find you one with manual since their top salesperson drives one with manualand asking around they all love stickshifts especially in the roadsters the c class minus the sunroof nav and other electronic fluff with a manual gearbox is a joy to drive and actually quite reliableits the electricals and accessories that fail on them  same as volkswagensame electronicselectrical suppliers for almost all german cars nav garmann and save 1000 plus it goes with you if you need it to the sunroofs too far back to be useable in the cclass imo  so better off ignoring it  plus a moonroof is basically a magnifying glass on a hot day all it does is heat your car up even more    i almost bought a c230k this winter certified yada yada  but decided to wait until this fall to get the right pricecolor stickshift and that 18l supercharged engine is a fantastic combination its hard to find a c230 sedan with manual thoughsilly high resale value as almost nobody wants to sell theirs    btw  the turnaround time on a manual c class is about 2448 hours here in los angeles as soon as the ad is online its gone in hours new or used automatics yeah sometimes they sit for months,plekto

2151,March 2007,its very dealerdependant though the dealership in van nuys ca for instance doesnt act like manuals exist lol valencia also same deal oddly enough beverly hills groks manuals course they want full msrp and act like you need a reservation as expected p    the shame about sunroofs is that almost all new cars moved them back 46 inches to accomodate the lightsgarage openeretc cluster on the ceiling this places it too far back to be viewed out of while you are driving you can feel the wind and stick your arm up and such but unless you turn your head sideways you see no sky    and they leak and cost a fortune to fix when they get older just not my thing now a porsche 968 with its cavernous gaping wound of a sunroof ah thats a whole other story,plekto
2152,March 2007,and they leak and cost a fortune to fix when they get older just not my thing now a porsche 968 with its cavernous gaping wound of a sunroof ah thats a whole other story    ah the ole 968 i saw one on the road the other day made me reflect on how much the world has changed in such a short time    btw a genius car salesman tried to tell us recently that the sky roof on the audi  two giant pieces of glass atop the car  helps to keep the vehicle cool my fiancee looked back at him and asked are you mazdar with the term greenhouse effect    same guy also tried to tell us the dsg tranny was the same as a porsche tiptronic honestly they need to test these guys,blueguydotcom
2153,March 2007,what kind of audi did your fiance end up getting    i have to admit i find my audi to be the most fun to drive car ive ever been inlet alone driven i used to not have fun driving especially with traffic in ca but the audi changed that now i just wanna drive to drive the audi    the sport package suspension works wonders  toy 16 audi tts audi awd commuter 17 volkswagen volkswagen alltrack se 4motion awd wifes 16 kia kia chrysler 16t fwd,andres3

2159,March 2007,oh hmmm the audi feels far lighter and more responsive move the wheel and the car responds now and the chassis doesnt slowly react like bmw e90 the engine pulls and pulls effortlessly its disquieting how the 20t just starts pulling and never really lets up of course the seamless near instant shifts of the dsg also help make engine always seem like its at the top of the cars 207 ftlbs of torque again lighter car fast tranny strong torque  fun    now its light and responds quickly unfortunately for me the heavy understeer of fwd still seems foreign i dont recall my protege es exhibiting so much understeer also the audis heavier and more noseheavy i think than my old 2003 es that may explain it some regardless theres front end plow and as she got the premium package the suspensions not set up for my aggressive style    for her its perfect some sport lots of fun lots of utility and enough luxury to keep her happy for me its too soft  i knew that from 20052006 test drives  but amusing nonetheless    im actually stuck in a predicament as i was aiming for the 4 door volkswagen but having two mrk vbased cars with the same enginetrannychassis might be too creepy damn volkswagen for not offering the r32 as a 4 door im supposed to show my 330i to a perspective buyer tomorrow another guy offered to fly in this weekend from sf and i must say im now a little at a loss perhaps a miata for a year or two or maybe a mini for a year or two keep the bimmer for the remaining 11 months and start over in 08 gotta ponder it all as i feel ill thinking about having almost near twin cars,blueguydotcom

2161,March 2007,and the bmw has been the benchmark in this segment that every manufacturer lines up as a target as of now none have surpassed it i am glad actually that the e90 was not bangelized,03accordman
2162,March 2007,if you put on a pair of gloves made from bmw seat leather you probably wont be able to bend your fingers very far    i wish we could test this its a great thought and i wonder if this is true    i know that leather quality seems to have dropped in recent years in a lot of cars but i think the seat itself has a lot to do with it as well  soft glovelike leather on a typical seat core would slip around and wrinkle over time  the seat needs to be soft and deep enough to allow for this,scottm123
2163,March 2007,here in nj bmw are a dime a dozen and i dont see any prestige associated with them    prestige is subjective but the drive does it for me it really is only about that not onedimensional but a compilation of the many relevant factors combining for an experience better than the other ellps candidates period    i do not care if anyone else thinks ive made it or not actually take the badge off and run dodge good for me as well a great machine is just that no need to brag just business    regards  ow,circlew
2164,March 2007,we are not talking about the toyota or sts none of the cars in this segment are applicance cars while sales isnt the be all and end all when is the last time the 3 series won coty yet a fantastic car that has horrible sales will not live a long life if this is even possible    i would assume most people here dont like the toyota and yet it sells over 400k copies a year so im not sure what sales prove    the toyota against the ferrari proves nothing the toyota against the honda is another story,kdshapiro
2165,March 2007,i dont think most people would argue there is an appreciable difference in everyday driving even auto writers know that the tests they conduct on cars are not representative of normal driving conditions bmw are great for winning cd comparos that have no correlation to normal driving but bmw are no better than other similar vehicles 99 of the time    i assume you look forward to commute because you love your car the same could be said for anyone who loves their car someone who loves the lexus probably looks forward to driving it every day,1487
2166,March 2007,most cars are used as appliances regardless of their performance capabilties sure the 3 is more capable of tackling a track than a toyota but for most people its not going to make a difference especially today when a toyota get accelerate as fast as a 35k bmw people buy luxury cars for features styling performance and prestige increasingly you can get performance and features in cheaper cars    toyota vs 3 series may not count but lexus vs bmw does count and lexus is the best seller one could argue that lexus has figured out what american consumers want moreso than any of their competitors soft luxury sells obviously the es has one engine and body style and still racks up 70k in sales i think that is pretty substantial considering the 3 series has a much broader model lineup,1487
2167,March 2007,all luxury cars are purchased for their prestige factor there isnt much else to justify paying the high prices commanded by luxury vehicles today powerful engines nice interior luxury features etc are available on non luxury brands today    the prestige factor doesnt only apply to bmw purchases dont know who said that was the case,1487
2168,March 2007,none surpassed it hondaing to whom while cd refuses to say any car beats a 3 series one could argue that pontiac5 owners feel the 3 series has been surpassed because otherwise they wouldve gotten a 3    for my money the pontiac5 is the better car the 3 may have slightly better handling but that doesnt mean its wholly superior there is more to a car than track numbers i think the pontiac5 has a far better interior better pricing and equal overall performance,1487
2169,March 2007,bmw does have heritage but so does cadillac mb and jaguar only the japanese brands lack heritage bmw has only recently risen to the 2nd place spot in us luxury sales and that is due to a proliferation of models 10 years ago there was no x5 x3 or 6 series their lineup gets bigger and their sales continue to increase they will be adding another suv and the 1 series so i suspect their sales will continue to climb if bmw stuck to making sporty cars only its sales would be subtantialy lower in the us 6 or 7 years back bmw was behind lexus cadillac and mb in sales but they have come on strong with all their new models and variations on those models    bmw sells cars based on it carefully crafted image and advertising in reality its not that their cars do stuff that cant be done by others its the impression that only bmw makes sports sedanhyundai that drives their reputation to mythical levels,1487
2170,March 2007,you dont get it do you,03accordman
2171,March 2007,people who but bmw know there is a difference which they like others have other likings and preferences so they choose something else its a free country and isnt competition great    how can you comment on why bmw owners buy them,03accordman
2172,March 2007,pick any reviews the bimmer has been selected at the top of most of them most manufacturers admit the 3 is the target so be it    for your money you would prefer a pontiac5 sure go ahead but when we talk of comparisons the bimmer usually wins and not only in cd look around a bit,03accordman
2173,March 2007,again you generalize why luxury cars are bought people buy these cars for different reasons could be prestige for someone and something else for others please dont speak for anyone    if your assumption was true then do you contend that people who buy hondatoyota over hyundaigm cars do so becasue of prestige because all features found on hondatoyota can be found on cheaper huyndaigmford cars would it ever dawn on you that someone may not really like the pos pontiac and instead pick and honda or a toyota even though they are more expensive,03accordman

2176,March 2007,think the price has something to do with whether or not people have a problem with leather coming standard at 30k this might be acceptable but not at 35k and up    again mb audi and bmw all do this    i think they all should have leather standard but as i said its not standard so they can ship 90 of the car with optional leather and make the car more expensive    oh those evil capitalists showing a product sans leather to market a lower starting price golly thats unheard of oh wait lexus does that too,blueguydotcom
2177,March 2007,ive never read of any complaints about lack of comfort in the cts or is their seats seem just as eurofirm as any bmw or mb when i said the leather was soft i meant that it was glove like and supple i didnt say the seats were soft soft seats are kind of a thing of the past    unless youre in an lexus or tl then theyre an everyday occurrence ditto audi    mb seats are too wide and flat for me pontiac5 seats were decent,blueguydotcom
2178,March 2007,i assume you look forward to commute because you love your car the same could be said for anyone who loves their car someone who loves the lexus probably looks forward to driving it every day    i dont love my car or really like it but the drive in is fun chevroletly because of the way the car handles a series of banked corners and esses on my way to the freeway each morning i look forward to that 15 mile stretch    ive got two potential buyers for my e90 right now and im not entirely sure i can give up that feeling on corners i may find the car lumbering heavy slow and bland 95 of the time but when i think about cornering in a fwd car i feel ill at the lack of fun it will entail,blueguydotcom
2179,March 2007,there is more to a car than track numbers i think the pontiac5 has a far better interior better pricing and equal overall performance      id agree on the first to get swivel bixenons memory seats and a moonroof id have to get the navi tech package and premium packages pushing the price up to 385k    huh my bmw outfitted the way i want  infiniti bixenons moonroof memory seats comfort access pdc and leather comes out to 384k without leather its 371k i think i can live without leather regardless the pontiac5 doesnt appear to be at a startlingly good price point for what i want and performance wise the 07 gs handling isnt there and the gs power is not even close to a bmw,blueguydotcom
2180,March 2007,not sure what you are referring to,1487
2181,March 2007,306hp isnt close to 300hp interesting viewpoint i thought they were pretty close i dont have pontiac5 pricing handy but seeing as though the model in the recent cd comparo was cheaper than a 328 without nav i find it strange that you think the pontiac5 is more expensive comparably equipped based on what i remember a loaded pontiac5 is about 7k cheaper than a loaded bmw,1487
2182,March 2007,cd does more comparisons than other publications i cant recall the results of the last rt comparo with the 3 series but i do know bmw often dont win in rt because of their objective scoring system the cts beat the 530 and other cars in a 2004 comparo because it matched the performance of the europeans and cost less,1487
2183,March 2007,unless youre in an lexus or tl then theyre an everyday occurrence ditto audi     any references from long term tests to back this up i dont recall reading much about lack of seat comfort in lexus or acura models seat comfort doesnt seem to be a major complaint in long term tests of luxury models in general perhaps you dont like the seats in nonbmw models but i havent read anything to corroborate your view,1487
2184,March 2007,i dont love my car or really like it but the drive in is fun chevroletly because of the way the car handles a series of banked corners and esses on my way to the freeway each morning i look forward to that 15 mile stretch     sounds good and i dont doubt the 3 series handling prowess my argument is there are 3 or more other cars that could do the same thing and give you the same enjoyment its not as if the only choices on the market are 3 series or toyota sporty sedans are plentiful in 2007,1487
2185,March 2007,mt cd rt all picked the 3 series over its competitors,03accordman
2186,March 2007,sporty sedans are plentiful in 2007    none in its segment surpass the 3 as far as sport goes,03accordman
2187,March 2007,306hp isnt close to 300hp interesting viewpoint i thought they were pretty close i dont have pontiac5 pricing handy but seeing as though the model in the recent cd comparo was cheaper than a 328 without nav i find it strange that you think the pontiac5 is more expensive comparably equipped    with a 266 ftlbs of torque and only about 270 whp yeah id say the pontiac5 is easily outclassed by a bmw in regard to power ive never seen a pontiac5 even come close to 5 seconds let alone sub 5 seconds on a 060 run    to get swivel xenons you must get the tech package thus adding on worthless doodads like navi and pushing the price to over 38k,blueguydotcom
2188,March 2007,sorry about that i was referring to the driving experience difference of a 3 vs competitors,03accordman
2189,March 2007,most comparison tests have the g trailing the 335 by about half a sec to 60 if not more,03accordman
2190,March 2007,any references from long term tests to back this up i dont recall reading much about lack of seat comfort in lexus or acura models    who said seat comfort im talking about soft seats the is tl and audi all surffer from insufferably soft lounger chairs    seat comfort doesnt seem to be a major complaint in long term tests of luxury models in general perhaps you dont like the seats in nonbmw models but i havent read anything to corroborate your view    reviews dont mean something is a fact good lord its just as subjective as everything written here no difference,blueguydotcom
2191,March 2007,the tl is an outstanding value and this fact is recognized my almost everyone it gives you a lot for the money and it a far more reasonably priced than a bmw    funny i just priced a base tl and a bmw with leather because i know some folks care about that and they came within 300 of each other    tl  34300  bmw  34600    so how exactly is the tl far more reasonably priced,fedlawman
2192,March 2007,for those that wont drive fwd cars its apparent they need to look in the els category for a car if we put aside drive wheels and look at performance and features we find that many cars in this class seem overpriced compared to loaded regular cars of course a loaded toyota or nissan doesnt come with the same prestige as a luxury branded saloon so many people would much rather drive a base model audi or 328 as opposed to a loaded non luxury car    i dont think fun to drive cars are limited to rwd so i wouldnt be pressed to buy a car in this class new unless i could comforably afford it i would definitely get a used 08 cts or pontiac5 though there is little value in luxury cars these days especially since technology is racing to the lower end of the market like never before features that were luxury exclusives a few short years ago are now found on cars under 25k of course many will argue the extra money is worth it due to driving feel and things you only notice if youre a bmw owner and all that dont buy it if these same cars were branded nissan or pontiacs interest in them would drop significantly especially amongst sport sedan poser owners who buy based on the badge,1487
2193,March 2007,features the tl is loaded at that price add memory heated seats leather sunroof top sound system etc to the 328 it is pointless to compare prices without mentioning equipment levels the nissan loaded up costs more than a base bmw but it has way more equipment so it would be ridiculous to say the 328 is as affordable as the nissan,1487
2194,March 2007,both the g and the 328 were too small for me but they definitely go head to head    what i dont get is how everyone has decided bmw newly turboed 335 is as reliable as the gs or others in this comparoproven power plant this engine could end up being a total thorn in the paw    i wouldnt buy any turboed car,goodegg
2195,March 2007,valid point you dont get much more in the entry luxury class than you do with a fully loaded midsize car these days i was trying to limit my price comparisons to cars in this class there are plenty of cars cheaper than the 3 series but unless they are in this class i dont think its relevant    exactly why even buy any cars in this class at all the tl and honda are the same platform and both are excellent vehicles how does one looking for value justify buying a tl over as honda a couple of minor suspension upgrades will put the honda fairly close to the tl in ridehandling,03accordman
2196,March 2007, i might take a look at the cts for sgs     im not sure what you mean by that but i assume you mean you will take a look at the cts just for fun but have no intentions of liking the car what are you basing this on what do you find lacking in the new cts i have been in the pontiac5s new interior several times and i like it but i would be shocked if the new cts interior isnt superior the curretne cadillac interior is extremely nice and i suspect the cts interior will be even better if thats the case i would rank the cts interior above the pontiac5 i am already ranking the cts superior in exterior styling because i am lukewarm about the gs shape a little too dull and evolutionary,1487
2197,March 2007,the tl is loaded at that price add memory heated seats leather sunroof top sound system etc to the 328    the base bmw comes standard with memory heated seats moonroof and amfmcdmp3 10 speaker audio system add leather interior and it costs 300 more than a tl,fedlawman
2198,March 2007,i think we all know the tl has far more features than the honda hids memory 14more hp superior interior dolby 51 sound system xm nav traffic trip computer etc if the engine is your only concern than there is no reason to buy the tl,1487
2199,March 2007,just checked here on edmunds a 328 with leather hids 8way seats with memory logic7 sound auto and heated seats will run you 39590 with automatic subtract 1275 for manual tranny i dont think its cheaper than the tl where did you get your pricing the car i just priced out is probably just like the one in the cd issue except they had a manual and sport package either way their car was about 39k without nav,1487
2200,March 2007,i wanted a rwd compact sport wagon and my sticking points were six cylinders leather and handling even if i took out the handling and leather at the time i had two choices both ellp as of today thats down to one and not a very attractive one at that    if somebody couldve delivered the essential elements in a nonellp marque i would have taken it the doodaddery on the current crop do nothing to enhance the experience whatsoever imo,wale_bate1
2201,March 2007,i think we all know the tl has far more features than the honda    actually heres what the tl has that the honda v6 honda doesnt    14 hp bigger brakes larger sway bars and wider tires dvdaudio bluetooth interface driver memory settings for seats and mirrors bixenon headlights and fog lights    the tl costs 6000 more than the honda,fedlawman

2204,March 2007,cts i will evaluate if i could ever live with this car but seriously doubt i would ever buy it i am talking the 08 in the late summerfall too many caddy gremlins in my past    i actually loved the shape of the g coupe but the prior sedans lines elicit no appeal imo the 07 however have more appeal to me    i had fun with my fwd 97 gtp i believe the more capable a given car is based on what extent it can defy physics the more the corners rise on both ends of your smile    regards  ow,circlew
2205,March 2007,of course many will argue the extra money is worth it due to driving feel and things you only notice if youre a bmw owner and all that dont buy it    you dont believe a honda has a certain feel mazda lack a feel    car companies have corporate philosophies and some design specific traits into their vehicles a honda feels like a honda  be it a fit or a tl there is something distinctly honda in their cars    ditto mazda given the option a mazda tends to be my preference for all sub luxury cars    dna is subjective but i think many beyond you would agree that honda mazda porsche volkswagenaudi have a distinctive feel,blueguydotcom
2206,March 2007,i have a tl and would love it more if it had the 4yr 50k maintenance free plan that bmw has    i guess you would have to add that into the equation at the very very least it would offset the 300 difference,ggesq
2207,March 2007,if youre buying based on price consider saving for 6 months and buying what you love p,blueguydotcom
2208,March 2007,im that case are you willing to get these features at the cost difference which at todays prices is more like 68k    how about a loaded alitma that will have most of these features better yet how about an hyundai with will trump any of these cars  featurebang for the buck wise,03accordman
2209,March 2007,fed    your gonna have to add the premium package as well to get similarly equipped vehicles which brings the price difference higher,ggesq
2210,March 2007,no offense to your caddy gremlins but unless your problems were with a rwd cadillac i wouldnt relate them to the cts the sigma models have nothing to do with caddy models prior to 2002 besides i dont know how long you keep a car but the 5 year powertrain warranty should ease your mind to some degree caddy is no worse than the germans in the reliabiity dept,1487
2211,March 2007,hell just go honda honda used thatll run you less than 16k    everybody is forded on the dollars but when it comes to subjective rationale they act like theyre being rational i got a 33k tl because it had bluetooth and leather while the 36k audi didnt the audi is overpriced because it lacks bluetooth uh but maybe someone wanted audi    no no no its rational to pick the cheaper object because it has more but its irrational to pick the more expensive car that has a featureability you deem essential,blueguydotcom
2212,March 2007,since i do 90 of my driving in urban areas and have little use for 88g skippad ratings and 5050 weight distribution i would probably opt for a much cheaper nicely optioned fwd car for under 30k if i suddenly got a 20 raise i might recondider and get a new cts since ive driven so many of these cars at various manufacturer events i have come to see them as regular cars and question their price tags i like the cars but not for nearly 40k for those with the means to drive these cars it may be a different story but anything over 35k is a lot to pay for a car when youre in my income range not that many people with my income arent driving luxury cars because that couldnt be farther from the truth,1487
2213,March 2007,no no no its rational to pick the cheaper object because it has more but its irrational to pick the more expensive car that has a featureability you deem essential     dont see your point what essential features are the cheaper cars in this class lacking rwd isnt an essential feature for many car buyers im talking luxury or technology features,1487
2214,March 2007,dont see your point what essential features are the cheaper cars in this class lacking rwd isnt an essential feature for many car buyers im talking luxury or technology features    muhahahahah youre proving my point youve decided rwd is not a feature some of us can deem essential youre saying its all about featuresperdollar but fail to see many people place rwd or manual as a feature thats worth more dollars than bluetooth or leather    thank you for proving my point,blueguydotcom
2215,March 2007,the important thing here is your preference and thats totally respected only you can decide for yourself if 35k is the threshold not someone else    similarly you may not decide for someone else if its worth their while to buy something over 35k or 25k or even less hell today even a nissan comes with a bluetooth and a cracker of an audio system if thats what one is looking for,03accordman

2220,March 2007,what essential features are the cheaper cars in this class lacking    subjective subjective subjective one mans essential is another mans folly eg xm is not an essential to me hence i did not renew the subscription for other folks they wont drive without it    as is value subjective folks keep saying that a bmw is not a good value howeverif you want a bmw and you get it for the best price you believe to be possible youve gotten a good value sure a g or tl can similarly equipped cost less  but if it is not the car you want it is not a good value unless you yourself can reconcile the fact that you got your second choice and decide there is more value in this fact than acquiring the bmw    i drive a tl best car for me better than a cts 3 audi cclass for now at least until i decide something is better ymmv  13 jaguar xf possibly my favorite of all the cars ive owned but my 09 jag xk was a beauty as was my 05 acura tl 88 acura acura 84 mitsubishi mirage turbo  78 volkswagen scirocco my first and of course the 92 nissan nissan ser and 95 saab 900s i bought for the ex ok i like a lot of the cars in my life,laurasdada
2221,March 2007,all of my statements on value are based on features that are offered for the dollar    the problem is youre placing your personal values into the equation if you define luxury as feature content performance as 060 acceleration time and value as most features for the dollar then lets declare the pontiac5 the winner and close this discussion    fortunately there are as many definitions of luxury performance and value as there are people on the planet well almost anyways    is the pontiac5 the best ellps value here because it has 18 wheels hids leather seats memory settings 300hp and rwd for only 33000 for some it is    but if all that mattered was features for the dollar then porsche would be out of business tomorrow    how is a 911s worth 80000 when you can buy a 400hp chevrolet loaded with selective ride control dual roof package cashmere seating with embroidered flags emblem and onstar for only 50000    some folks like the feel of cashmere on their tushy and some folks like to drive,fedlawman

2228,March 2007,i actually just pulled the trigger on a lexusrwd with navi and 18 tires for my fiance its a great car but in my opinion its a different type of car for a different type of buyer    sure many on here differ completely in their stance on a lot of the cars we critique here but to me what we consider ellps on here are vastly different from the lexus some on here would argue and they are entitled to do so that some if not most of the ellps are not true performers but when every car on that list above has above avg acceleration above avg handling and above avg braking they should all be considered above avg performers i think thats an extremely reasonable statement    i find the lexus to be more refined than the cars in the ellps class and thats not a bad thing its a gorgeous car inside and out its very comfortable its got a boatload of creature comforts at your fingertips and its got outstanding acceleration but from there to me its handling and braking lag the avg of this class and that takes its fun to drive factor down a bit from the avg ellps which is not to say the car is entirely not fun to drive    if the car fits your needs as it did my fiances and you can afford it then go for it enjoy it and tell us about it after youve taken delivery of it,hauss

2231,March 2007,billy    good to hear from you unfortunately i cant offer much of an opinion since i have not driven the new gs friend of mine is seriously considering one lexush i think but he and his wife are far more interested in luxury than a sporty drive he currently has a 1999  gs300 that although pretty slow and soft by current standards has been absolutely bulletproof and still looks nice for him the new gs would be a big jump up in driving pleasure without giving up the lexus luxury they have become accustomed to    only thing i might suggest if you are jumping up to the gs price range and size and are ok with rwd would be to investigate the new bmw i dont know ifwhen it will be available but it would be the sporty alternative to the gs edmunds doesnt have much info but i saw some pricing info posted in another forum buying or leasing a bmw through ed makes them a lot more price competitive than most people realize if you are up for going through the process    good luck and keep in touch,habitat1

2234,March 2007,well if bmw still covers the shipping charges in their destination charge im confused as to what advantage there is for them to sell you the car over there i guess it just cuts out the cost of the middle man aka the dealership do you actually sign all the paperwork over there as you take delivery i wonder if its possible to not even go over there to get the vehicle if you could handle all the paperwork via email and scanned copies and then hire a proxy to get the car to you or give someone power of attorney over there to do it for you,hauss
2235,March 2007,a couple of points    the buyer still pays the destination charges regardless of whether the car is sourced via ed or domestically    you still need to involve your local dealership in the ordering process that said to them ed orders are like found money as ed cars dont come out of their allocation but do count toward gaining future allocations    all of the paperwork shy of a few bits that are signed at delivery are signed at your local dealership    as a general rule you cannot use a proxy to fetch your car said another way if you aint one of the owners you aint gittin the car the only exception to this rule that ive ever heard about was for folks who couldnt or wouldnt travel shortly after the wtc attack    best regards  shipo,shipo
2236,March 2007,well if bmw still covers the shipping charges in their destination charge im confused as to what advantage there is for them to sell you the car over there i guess it just cuts out the cost of the middle man aka the dealership    dealership is totally involved and they make about 10001200 profit simply for filing paperwork and pdiing your car plus any backend on the mf andor loan the order doesnt come out of allocations so they make money but dont lose a sale    additionally if you lease bmw pays the second month of the lease while the car is in shipment    do you actually sign all the paperwork over there as you take delivery    sign for just about everything in the us when you take delivery they have you sign off a few more docs but i recall most of those were related to insurance and such over there    i wonder if its possible to not even go over there to get the vehicle if you could handle all the paperwork via email and scanned copies and then hire a proxy to get the car to you or give someone power of attorney over there to do it for you    no you provide a copy of your passport when you order the car they will release the car to the person with that passport    this progdodge has been around for decades,blueguydotcom

2240,March 2007,the e46s backseat was big enough to fit two adults in my backseat good enough for me and my friends kids are smaller so they are not a problem either i frequently had a 63 friend in my e46 and he said he was comfortable i could fit behind myself easily for a rarely used backseat it was more than adequate with kids itd be fine too roadtrips are a thing of the past with airfare so cheap so its not like the kids or anyone would ever be back there for more than an hour or two on a drive to la    audi and a volkswagen do not share a chassis drivetrain or really much of anything beyond a 20t thats mounted differently one is longitudinal the other horizontal not sure where you got that the audi is a volkswagen thats utter balderdash,blueguydotcom
2241,March 2007,it was a bimmer salesguy that told me that i kind of took it with a grain of salt for obvious reasons he was right about the audis back seat being small actually the front seat of the audi is the only car ive ever sat in that made me feel fat im glad that the audi isnt a glorified volkswagen i will definitely withdraw the inference i made    the germans automakers really dont believe in synergies do they mercedes benz doesnt want to share too much with chrysler and bmw doesnt appear to care about lacking a midsized mass market sedan i guess audi and lambo are the only ones that share    the e46s backseat isnt that bad however i wont call it spacious for anyone above 510 however the backseat headroom in the e90 door is just painful i bumped my head entering and exiting twice while sober with my buddy driving i wont even mention the times after we started drinking simply because i cant remember them blush  your 63 friend can sit in the back of an e90 without complaining is he like a contortionist or something i couldnt imagine being 63 and being comfortable in the back of a cts or tl best in this class    no road trips blueguy you are definitely californian i love you for that you remind me of all my friends in the bay area that thought i was nuts whenever i drove from mountain view to la    this was pre911 they all said there are planes for that lol seriously arent we supposed to be enthusiasts here who love to drive i remember taking my cough sport sedan 1994 pontiac pontiac se down the 5 to la highway cruising is definitely a different driving experience than going on the track or the twisties but i wouldnt say its not fun    blueguy wouldnt you want to run your e46 through west texas hitting the electronic limiter just for fun,allargon
2242,March 2007,when looking at bmw site the highest discount for the 3 series is 3435 for the bmw convertible    did you negotiate down from the ed savings or did you do something else    i assumed you would just have to take the car at msrp  ed discount,ivan_99
2243,March 2007,ed is worth it imo because you get a pretty good discount get to pick up your car tool around europe if you like and go on the suggested tours and make a vacation out of it its especially sweet if you have enough miles saved up so your trip can be free    on the other hand if you dont have miles  dont have time off from work to get a vacation then the  spent on the trip however short lived it may be narrows the gap you actually save by doing the ed progdodge    from my reading of the ed progdodge on bmw site it seems like a pretty cool progdodge ie if i ever to decide to get into a bmw    just my 02 correct me if im wrong,ggesq
2244,March 2007,when looking at bmw site the highest discount for the 3 series is 3435 for the bmw convertible    do you normally start negotiating to buy a car based on the msrp or invoice same with ed theres ed pricing and theres ed invoice you start at ed invoice pricing and work up people who buy based on ed msrp are the same rubes who buy cars at msrp    i assumed you would just have to take the car at msrp  ed discount    nope start at the lowest price they pay and tack on a profit for them  most often 1k    if im not mistaken base ed invoice is 34950 for the e92 base msrp is 40800 options are invoice priced too so every option creates a wider and wider gulf,blueguydotcom

2246,March 2007,i assumed you would just have to take the car at msrp  ed discount    egad perish the thought why give the dealer all that money i dont mean that you should make them starve however i think 1000 to 1200 is more than enough profit for filling out a little paperwork i mean they are selling you a car that they wouldnt be able to sell were it not for the fact that you are willing to go to europe to get it    the proper way imho to buy or lease an ed car is to find out what the ed invoice is on the car add the shipping charges the invoice of any options you might want and say 1000 for dealer profit then you make your local dealership an offer some dealers will take the deal some wont the dealership where i leased my first bmw from didnt i went fifteen miles down the road literally the same road even and made the same offer done deal in under an hour i picked the car up seven weeks later    best regards  shipo,shipo

2248,March 2007,to those that might have thought the bmw ed price msrp was nonnegotiable that is the case for mercedes benz and volvo those dealers make a fixed fee for handling an ed order that is significantly less than the markup a bmw dealer makes on an ed msrp sale    for a long time there was a secret pact amoung bmw dealers in my area not to discount ed prices then one dealer left the cartel in about 20002001 and the secret was out and discounts were in,habitat1

2250,March 2007,obviously i own an xtype and i take the surveys and mag articles with a grain of salt in my opinion the truth is  1 the 2002 xtype had a bunch of niggling problems and one major problem  the trannys in a bunch of them failed ford rushed the car to market before it was fully sorted out and pissed off a bunch of first time buyers  2 by the 2003 model year ford had recalled and replaced all the bad trannys and addressed some of the other niggling problems however by then ford had really sullied the cars reputation  3 the following model years continued to get better ford continued to improve the vehicle mechanically however they missed the boat by not introducing a larger engined r model to compete head to head with bmw infiniti etc this would have reignited interest in the line the car continued to move up in various quality surveys but few were paying attention in addition jags advertising department was and remains absolutely impotent  5 today the car is vastly improved over what it was in 2002 jag too late in my opinion has reduced prices and added features that make the car a relative bargain when compared to comparably equipped competitors it still lacks a flagship model and its too late to introduce one now at its current price point its hard to beat but few consider it enthusiasts sneer because 5 speed manual sport models are no longer available in the us    regards  oldcem,oldcem
2251,March 2007,as for the 3series vs hyundai cost discussion are you guys serious    well the numbers are factually correct it is indeed cheaper to get a 3 series than getting a hyundai im making that business decision precisely because a 3 series is cheaper to keep for a couple years than a toyota or honda may as well give my employees a little incentive that doesnt cost me any extra actually saving a few pennies even after counting the trip cost which makes the european trip taxwritable    as for whether cost is relevent if someone wants to disqualify acura on cost ground we may as well examine what the real costs are for the other entries,brightness04

2256,March 2007,actually the best place for this continued bmw ed connissantion is the bmw european delivery discussion that was linked previously and i also am shaking my head at how the hyundai snuck its way in here thanks for your thoughts    folks lets get back to the subject please,pat
2257,March 2007,hyundai first came up in post9210    but as long as were talking value here why not consider the 23000 hyundai hyundai limited    as a rhetoric question    what people seldomly realize is that with lease subsidies nowadays bmw actually are even cheaper than some of the cussword cheap cars,brightness04
2258,March 2007,actually yes it would but the article compared a sonota 4k in damages to an honda eg 1000 in damages i have first hand knowledge about getting into a suzukind collision in a 3 series,kdshapiro
2259,March 2007,you may choose to pay destination charge lease inception fee and sales tax up front instead of by monthly payment but these costs still exist similarly there is travel expenses involved even if you have one million frequent flyer miles the bottom line is the true monthly cost to lease a bmw for 2 ysubaru2k mile is approx 370 before tax 400 after tax    imho saying that one can lease a bmw for 277mo with no cap cost reduction and thus a better deal than a hyundai is like false advertising you would need to add fine print as 1 2100 up front cost to cover destination charge lease inception and sales tax 2 900 in travel expenses to munich to pick up your car total 3000 divided by 24 is 125 add that to 277 you get 402    speaking of ad the deal on bmw website is 329mo with 2500 down payment it includes auto transmission 1210 option but only 10k miles per year 1 residual difference the effect to payment is about a wash the true monthly cost is about 400 before tax my example in previous post is 400 after tax,jtla
2260,March 2007,sorry didnt see louisweis and your post earlier this isnt really about lease or ed question i just cant see people using misleading payment figure and compare bmw with hyundai anyway i made my point so i will just continue to enjoy reading all the fine posts on this forum,jtla
2261,March 2007,destination charge lease inception vs maitenance cost and sales tax all exist even if you decide to buy a hyundai the 23000 msrp suggested included none of that if you really want to grind through the numbers including all the ancillary numbers here we go for hyundai with cash purchase    invoice 200profit 21732  remember i gave the bwm dealer 1000 profit  destination fee 650  77 sales tax 1723  maintenance in yeasubaru and yeasubaru per edmunds 1005  total out of pocket 25110    compare to leasing bmw via ed  placing that 25110 that would have paid for the hyundai in treasury bills at 56 becomes at least 27684 at 5 after two years  even at chryslero go plug in the numbers yourself  24mo is only 6900 bmwfs pays one monty  destination 700  lease inception 625  disposal charge 325  flight and onenight accommodation 1000  150 just to be generous  total out of pocket 9700    so after two years 27684  9700  17984    do you honestly believe that a two year old hyundai hyundai can resell for 17984 the case is not even close not sure why you even bother debating me on this even if you tag on another 50mo to fatten the dealer do you believe a 2year old hyundai can sell for 16750 the number is the same if you insist on 400mo but wipe off the euro trip allowance of 1150 above like i said the numbers are not even close why do you even bother to debate me on this frankly if you insist on 400mo we should recaculate and use msrp5000 for the hyundai as apparently the hypothetical consumer is fond of paying more than the manufacturer suggested price,brightness04
2262,March 2007,why are you talking lease on one and not the other the leasing cost is one more thing that helped push me from infiniti to bmw,blueguydotcom
2263,March 2007,well the 24000 price for hyundai was suggested by the post that brought hyundai to this forum i have no clue what a hyundai lease is like is it below 292mo with no cap reduction and free maintenance included    btw i agree with you entirely on the influence of these lease deals im choosing the bmwx3 over toyotatoyota rav4 for my employees based on the fabulous lease deals thats why we have to use the least expensive way of getting a car as a measure of how much a car is really worth,brightness04
2264,March 2007,i think your math is way way off just go get your employees two mazdaudis negotiate two cars at 100 over invoice thus avoid cap cost and youre looking at around 200 a month per car maintenance on a mazdaudi is minimal  oil changes maybe a tuneup at 20k    httpwwwmazdausacommusawebdisplayregionalincentivesaction,blueguydotcom
2265,March 2007,i dont see anything about waiving cap reduction 2000 cap reduction works out to about 75mo in payment maintenance is about 700 for the first two years hondaing to edmunds that means another 25mo hmm 292mo for a bmw or just over chryslero for a stripped down hatchback with 100 less horsepower    i will take the bmw ,brightness04
2266,March 2007,as others and the host have spoken this is probably not a subject belongs here so i will make it short    i cant care less about hyundai all i am saying is that you cannot spend all those up front money and claim it costs you 277mo to lease a bmw if that is the true cost to you i would like to lease one from you heck i will even let you mark up 10,jtla
2267,March 2007,youre totally ignoring your other costs so you can arrive at a fallacious magic number the fact is a bmw lease is going to add on the 625 acquisition fee 1 month payment without use of the car cost to retrieve car and cost to replace car after only 22 months in service these costs cannot be ignored if youre performing any real cost analysis    over the course of 24 months even at your fake 300 a month rate multiplied by 23 youre looking at    lease cost 6900 but only 22 months of use  extra cost 625  retrieval cost 1200 bare minimum as theres also transportation costs in munich  tire replacement cost 1000 with 30k miles theres no way the cars rfts will be in good enough shape to return the car with same shoes    972522 months of use  442 per month and the other two months you will have to pay for something else    add in gas expenditures too a bmw can reasonably get 21 mpg combined using 2008 standards 15k miles  21 mpg  714 gallons per year premium gas is at least 3 a gallon thats 2142 per year on just gas,blueguydotcom
2268,March 2007,lol    no kidding send brightness to get the cars for all of us,blueguydotcom
2269,March 2007,i simply answered a rhetoric question by stating that i would pick a bmw over a 24k hyundai on pure cost consideration because leasing a bmw would cost a lot less than paying 24k for a hyundai if you dont care about hyundai and more importantly cant be bothered with simple arithmatics you should have thought through before accusing me of anything bmw can be leased at subchryslero without any capital reduction every lease comes with acquisition fee tax title insurance and gas are extra for any car lease or purchase    almost all cars excepting bmw also incurr maintenance expense there is nothing misleading about it i dont waste my time in business where my markup is only 10 on the other hand bmw dealers are quite willing to fill some paperwork for you for a 1000 profit without any cutting into their allocation the numbers i mentioned already included 1000 profit for the car dealer,brightness04
2270,March 2007,put my name down for your car so bmw munich will release the car to me  btw my regular billing rate is 200hr,brightness04
2271,March 2007,where is 30k miles from in a 24mo lease with 12kyr there is no tire replacement necessary within the 24k miles in question the use is 23 months as the delivery is 4 weeks for east coast where im located    625 acquisition fee is less than the first two years maintenance cost of a hyundai which hondaing to edmunds is 1005    gas expenditure come on now you are really reaching whats next the cost of taking the girl out to dinner     the 277mo should be 292mo with mf boosted by 00003 pardon me on the 15mo difference before taking into consideration the bump was simply the monthly payment number without cap reduction and without cap increase either from rolling other items in thats the common basis for comparing leases    yeah i know its incredulous but the bmw lease deals really are that good  im having a hard time believing the carmaker itself is making money on this,brightness04
2272,March 2007,ed  you make your first months payment 2 weeks before pickup the second months payment is made at best while the vehicle is in transit at best you might get 225 months    additionally you must return leased cars with tires over a certain tread depth i cannot recall the exact tread depth  maybe shipo recalls i know personally i wouldnt be close to that depth after 24k miles  assuming any tread is left on the tires at that point,blueguydotcom
2273,March 2007,minimum tire tread depth for lease car returns 5mm    my purchase of a set of winter wheels and tires paid for itself as all of my factory tires just passed the minimum and a set of factory sized summer rubber cost more than the winter wheels and tires combined     best regards  shipo,shipo

2275,March 2007,this is not a leasing discussion and its not a discussion which should keep getting hung up about hyundai costs there are lots of leasing discussions  feel free to use the search features to find one    we need to get back on topic,pat
2276,March 2007,i dont know about you hauss i was actually enjoying the 3series vs the world debate    p    as matter of fact ill start a little 3series vs allotherellps debate myself note this is coming from a nonenthusiast at least not about tracking the car and interior nuts point of view oh by the way this will also not be a price independent discussion    bmw vs tl draw  tl has the classleading design in interior and best value in class but its fwd bmw has a notsodesirable interior but is good in power and handling with the rwd advantage this could go either way depend on how important is the fwdrwd criteria to the buyers    bmw vs audi bmw  audi audi is outdated underpowered and overweight the only advantage it held over bmw is the better looking interior but that also looks like it belongs in the last generation which the audi uh is    bmw vs cts current bmw  hands down bmw in this case the only advantage the caddy has is the bigger interior space but to me that is mute since we are talking about ellps instead of midsize sedan here not going to comment about the 08 cts since it is not yet available and details are still waiting to be revealed    bmw vs pontiac5 pontiac5  pontiac5 has better value nicer looking interior rocksolid handling and one of the top engines in this segment the engine does not have the kick that the twinturbo 6 in the bmw has but is decent enough with the comparable equipped pontiac5s and bmw having a price difference around 68k msrp lets not go to that ed discussion here again please ill take that over 05 seconds faster in 060 any given day only thing lacking in the pontiac5 is the inferior material used inside the cabin    bmw vs lexus lexus  lexus has a good interior better in design than bmw and materials used are equally good if not better its engine might not be as torquey as the twinturbo 6 in the low rpm region but is the only one that could hang with it in this segment to me i couldnt notice much difference between the 2 with the lexus on power ect mode i am pretty sure a few tenth of a second difference is there but unless one is in a drag race that is really a nonissue the comparable equipped lexus is about 23k lower than the bmw so the value factor is still there if one must the only disadvantage for the lexus is its more isolated steering and notassharp handling    bmw vs cclass bmw  the current cclass is outdated overpriced so this one goes to bmw hands down i doubt if the new c could fair better since we know its a mb that means it will be overpriced also even the new c350 is considered underpowered in todays ellps segment,louiswei
2277,March 2007,thanks for clearing that up,1487
2278,March 2007,the factory original tires usually last between 3035k miles for me on the other hand the brakes wear out between 2030k my current car had to replace the brakes at 21k miles at a cost of 990 an expense that would have been avoided with bmw regardless leasing or buying    225mo vs 23mo is only 2 difference quite immaterial,brightness04
2279,March 2007,very much in agreement with your assessment on the vehicles themselves the value issue however gets very murky nowadays i am actually picking the 3 series over tl and pontiac5 on pricing alone the extra volume of tl and pontiac5 actually would have been nice in our case but the price is what sells even witout ed the high residual and low money factor actually make the 3 series cheaper than tl and pontiac5 or at least comparable in the case of tl lets not forget over 80 of new 3 series are leased and a vanishingly small per centage of people pay msrp even if they buy so the pricing issue is much trickier than just looking at msrp    for what its worth i actually did a cost analysis over 6 year period cars more than 6 years old are crap shoots or at least have the luxury and sport squeezed out of them having three brand new 3 series over 6 years beats having 1 tl 2 tl 3 tl or 1 pontiac5 2 pontiac5 3 pontiac5 over the same 6 year projection hands down in dollars and cents alone shorter assessment periods would make bmw margin of victory in this lowcost race even greater because the maintenance cost is paid by the manufacturer for the first 4 years,brightness04

2284,March 2007,the stervolkswagen nav systems power butt massagers etc available in many ellps are certainly nice features    but it seems much like the computer on your desk or rather lap they are evolving to the point where a 23 year old ellps is out of date and if you own a 45 year old ellps its a sign your career may have stalled    as ive stated numerous times before keeping my 1995 nissan nissan se with next to no options only abs for 10 years and 155k miles was a factor in my being comfortable splurging on a 911 when i hear of others getting a new 40k ellps every 3 years to keep up with the latest and greatest i can only respond that its your money    dropped off my 911 for a malfunctioning passenger power seat yesterday and a 60ish gentleman in a 1995 993 model 911 was picking up his car after an oil change looked like it had just come off the showroom floor in spite of 90000 miles he looked at my car with the power this and that nav system etc and just laughed with a comment that thank god my car doesnt have all that stuff to break,habitat1
2285,March 2007,thank god my car doesnt have all that stuff to break    yeah but the thing is    those things are getting pretty reliable nowaday which they dont break as much often well at least on the noneuropean imports that is    however i am still on the fence about the navi i hate to not be able to listen to my favorite music if the nav system decided not to corporate one day portable gps is still the way to imo at least for right now,louiswei

2287,March 2007,that 60ish guy you talked about sounds like my 74 year old father he thinks electronic components on anything are susceptible to high rates of failure it doesnt matter if were talking about the controls on a washerdryer a tv or a car its funny how people remember things one way sometimes and can never change their viewpoint,hauss
2288,March 2007,those things are getting pretty reliable nowaday which they dont break as much often    maybe you are right but my experience isnt great  our 2005 acura had to have the navigation control unit dvd reader under the passenger seat replaced twice first when it placed us in the atlantic ocean on the way home from boston and then when it just froze up and as i said my 911 is in the shop because the power passenger seat stopped working in an unusable far forward position no manual override to push it back    ive also heard of some malfunctioning bluetooth  voice activated electronics in both lexus and acura royal pain in the butt for a mechanic to try to figure out what the problem is and complete replacement of these systems is not cheap when its out of warranty a complete nav system replacement including screen would probably approach the grand total of all maintence and repairs on my nissan in 155k miles under 3500 including 38 oil changes    i admit that the gadget craze is here to stay with respect to ellps especially since there seem to be a lot more folks concerned about l than p i recall someone in this forum even claiming not offering ventilated seats as unacceptable in this segment but along with this gadgetry comes a lot of premature obsolescence given how long the actual car could last that 12 year old 993 model 911 sure looked great to me in spite of none of the accutriments that are required in subellps today and it could still kick the butt of almost any pure p car in any segment,habitat1
2289,March 2007,not to mention that 993 is probably still worth 40 of what he paid for it    you just cant find those and when you do the prices are astronomical  moderator    prices paid lease questions suvs,kyfdx

2311,April 2007,i have no problem acknowledging modernday improvements in safety the point is that sport has been compromised because of weight and we have little choice in the matter other than choosing from a range of vehicle types plenty of people buy cars and dont list safety as top priority anyone who buys a motorcycle sports car or cars in this thread falls into this category,designman
2312,April 2007,plenty of people buy cars and dont list safety as top priority anyone who buys a motorcycle sports car or cars in this thread falls into this category    i disagree somewhat unless you are talking about driving a sherman tank it is my opinion that the cars in this thread are safe cars for their weight class and are at least as safe if not safer than other comparable weightclass size vehicles certainly the 3 series is no less safe than the toyota or honda and in fact might be safer,kdshapiro
2313,April 2007,plenty of people buy cars and dont list safety as top priority anyone who buys a motorcycle sports car or cars in this thread falls into this category    because safety is a given in this category when you buy a motorcycle or go skydiving safety is a priority if you do not plan safety before hand with those kiss yourself goodbye sooner or later    sport is not compromised by weight if sport is only one factor in your preferences rather than weighted predominatly as the goal when one is at that higher level of sporting desire to me you are out of this category of vehicle you might track the car but there are many other choices that can excite at a much higher level    when i buy a vehicle for the road safety is a high priority better brakes handling ridgitity and improved systems such as airbags are a priority despite extra girth    again i look to racing with everimproving saftey system for high speed sporting as a learning for the rest of the industry    to each his own at the end of the day    regards  ow,circlew
2314,April 2007,by the numbers the e90 may perform better the feel of the cars thats another story ill gladly surrender airbags and sound insulation of that means the car literally feels lighter and has a been more road noiseroad feel coming through the chassis into the interior,blueguydotcom
2315,April 2007,to each his own at the end of the day    not really were all stuck with a 3600 lb bmw think of how cool it would be to have a choice for one that weighed 2800lbs this is the basis for complaint about weight gains over the years even the pure sports cars have gotten heavier ponderous    btw regardless of what safety measures one takes in any sport or endeavor said endeavor comes with inherent risks and some are much greater than others for instance flying small aircraft is said to have the highest risk out of all manner of transportation also hit an unanticipated oil slick on a bike and youre going down i dont care how safely you ride,designman
2316,April 2007,think of how cool it would be to have a choice for one that weighed 2800lbs    i agree with the idea of an ultimate 2800 lb 335 there would be a market for that car    im not sure the pure sports cars are ponderous however they are gaining weight but a c6 z06 is hardly ponderous a caymen s is even lighter 2976    yes you can always go down on an oil slick but you need to understand the risks and provide for the best result each time you play same with managing a piper cub preflights are no guarantee but without redundant safety systems the risks grow rather quickly    regards  ow,circlew

2318,April 2007,the chevrolet reference chevrolets a good question why does a 2007 chevrolet weigh 50 lbs less than a 1988 chevrolet while making 50 more hp while a 2007 bmw weighs 700 lbs more than the 88 with a similar  increase in power both increased in price about the same ,texases
2319,April 2007,the problem isnt safety equipment the carbmw 3 series really isnt any safer now than it was a few years ago its the couple of hundred pounds of sound deadening materialno really  that much power everything heavier sheetmetal and so on it all requires a heavier transmission brakes tires its a vicious cycle as the car gets heavier long gone are the days when the 3 series was a pure sports sedan now its a yuppie luxury car    now some cars can do it right the nissan which isnt a small car mind you is 3000lbs and a lot of people are impressed with it mainly because its 500600lbs lighter than most of the competition it needs less power smaller brakes and can get by without 17 inch rims    or take a mazda 3000lbs fully loaded it handles almost as well as a 3 series because it weighs 20 less with mods ive seen people drop another 200lbs off of it for racing without hardly changing a thing in its daily functioningmostly aluminum parts carbon fiber hood etc 2800lbs and 240 hp is a rocket in the twisties compared to the new cars 34 the weight will do that for you,plekto
2320,April 2007,luxury content the 20 year gap saw the bmw turn into a very quiet very cocooned isolated luxurious car the vettes still a vettejust with a bigger engine,blueguydotcom
2321,April 2007,for one chevrolet is a sports car bmw is a sedan fairer comparison would be chevrolet with 911 or a ferrari even that wouldnt be apples to apples because american cars have always been huge whereas european started out tiny and got progressively larger porsche and ferrari started racing cars with i4s    bmw still builds a lightweight car its called 11mazda the reason they dont export it here americans with money to burn prefer a heavyweight bmw thank you very much,mariner7
2322,April 2007,yep quietcocoonedisolatedluxurious i guess thats why they dropped the ultimate driving machine slogan,texases
2323,April 2007,junk dont know about the new model but the old model had nothing good going for it for those who dont need space for 4 people and luggage or can buy multiple cars you can have the mazdavettlexus0 for those who need to carry 4 people and luggage and dont want to buy another car because their first car has some space deficiencies the choice is more limited if you want more of a sporty feel,kdshapiro
2324,April 2007,actually i had an 07 nissan as a loaner for 2 days while my 06 e90 was getting its ac replaced its a pretty big step over the last gen nissan and definitely superior to the current toyotahonda for driver feedbackcontent for the dollar    is it on the level of a 33k bmw no but its significantly cheaper,blueguydotcom
2325,April 2007,i guess thats why they dropped the ultimate driving machine slogan    golly marketing slogans are always truthful having driven the e90 across europe at well over 100 for hours  including ripping down the autobahn at 140 for extended periods  i can say without hesitation that the car is isolated cocooned and not very involving 120 feels just like 50 the cars muted and lacks any verve i put 1400 miles on my e90 in europe if you want a car that handles sharply responds to input without fuss and rarely falters in twisties its above reproach in this segment if you desire excitement and edge of your seat funlook elsewhere,blueguydotcom
2326,April 2007,for those who dont need space for 4 people and luggage or can buy multiple cars you can have the mazdavettlexus0    actually the mazda seats four people quite nicely    my point is that they can make a car like the nissan sizewise and keep it light bmw and others surely could make a smaller car much lighter if they wanted to i notice a lot of bmw drivers switching to smaller cars like the mx5 and the subaru and so on bmw needs that 1 series fast or theyre going to lose their entire performance market in a decade    oh  the m model of the 1 seriesnot to be confused with the m1 is an absolute winner fast good looking reasonably affordable light enough    but not in the us duh,plekto
2327,April 2007,if you want to have a sports car that is feather light with high horsepower then you are going to have to modify it yourself there are two words that prevent manufacturers from building what you wantindustry standards the government is requiring more and more from manufactur in terms of industry standards which is why the lesser expensive cars arent so inexpensive anymore    remember bmw bmw csl it took out all of the sound deadening meterial and all the other stuff to decrease weight but how many of them did you see here in the us    now they are resorting to carbon fiber not just bmw to reduce weight which is a very expensive way to do it,papsephus
2328,April 2007,or bmw can just make 3series an aluminum fdodgee like the bmw has of course with the current bmw starting at around 40k one can only imaging how much an allaluminumfdodgeebmw will cost,louiswei
2329,April 2007,my point is that they can make a car like the nissan sizewise and keep it light    the nissan pre07 to me is an extremely unsafe car that i would hate to get into an accident it drove terribly wasnt particularly reliable and the sheet metal buckled when a nissan hit it so yes a light car can be made but the compromise isnt worth it i know this is ot but for the mazda ones mans cavernous backseat is another mans claustrophic trap you can have lightweight cars but there are very few that handle decently where there is a modicum of room for real family activities,kdshapiro
2330,April 2007,i never said the mazda was cavernous i just stated that it does fit four people and honestly beside kids who carries people in the rear of their car except on the occasional trip to the airport party or similar onetime exception    you dont need 3600lbs to be safe the old volvo 240 which was one of the safest cars ever barely weighed 2600lbs when it came out by 1993 it had bulked up with airbags abs and so on but was still under 3000 lbs by a healthy margin2919 lbs    the bloat is pure and simple frills like sound deadening and electronics and so on nothing to do with crash safety,plekto
2331,April 2007,the vette ride quality improved ddodgeaticly too in those 20 years the new vette is actually quite a smooth ride on highways imho the difference tex mentioned in vette vs 3 series is that    1 just like mariner mentioned vette hasnt changed much in vehicle size whereas the 3 series today is bigger than 5 series of 20 years ago in fact the wheelbase of todays 3 series is nearly half a foot longer than the wheelbase of 5 series of 20 years ago the europeans are finally making american sized cars because they are no longer facing material shortage relative to labor like they did decades ago the europeanbritish sportscar tradition was literally born of a necessity after wwii when they had little natural resources but a lot of mouths to feed they had to make something to trade for food import turning import steel to cars was one of the solutions thats why the value to weight ratio of those cars had to be high becaue much of the raw material for buildings cars had to be imported too hence very small cars at relatively high price and sportiness was sold those cars    2 vette is a technological and engineering tourdeforce everything is tried to save an ounce here and an ounce there im not even sure if gm makes any money on making vette its the halo car for the company on the other hand 3 series is the main source of income for bmw beancounting decisions have to be made for such a breadandbutter car for bmw for example making the body shell out of aluminum or fibergraphite composite material instead of good old heavy steel sheet metal is simply out of question for the regular 3 series,brightness04
2332,April 2007,mazda 3 sedanwagon would make for a decent sporty car that is light 27002900lbs and enough room for four however by the time volvo has done building ells on the same platform to produce s40v50 the car weighs 32003300lbs and has squeezed out much of the sportiness it may have something to do with what consumers demand in entry level luxury cars personally i would not buy any car weighing less than 3300lbs preferrably 3600lbs simply because thats the weight of an average decadeold jeep cherokee that a lot of high school kids learning to drive are driving i wouldnt want to place my family in anything weighing much less than what the most accidentprone population is driving,brightness04
2333,April 2007,kd agreed the nissan is out if you want real safety and real performance it really depends on the level that you expect and the balance delivered    the weight issue can be debated up and down the food chain regarding vehicle hierarchy sports cars are sports cars and ellps are what they are as well if there are 4 people in say an mazda you can not drive at 1010ths agreed    if one wants true performance in this segment at this point the bmw looks to me as where its at imho hefty perhaps alternative debatable    regards  ow,circlew
2334,April 2007,i agree with your assessment regarding the minimum weight desired and defensive safety for the family i believe this is why even today the bmw is a notch ahead of the pack here you get a higher level of performance with good safety at the expense of about 6 months of big macs under the belt    put another way sub 3k lbs 1360 kg in europe was ok when most cars were predominantly under that anyway even there the cars are plumping up so pure sports setups are more custom than what you can get stock as was more prevalent in the past    i say we draft a law that allows teenyboppers to only drive smart cars until they hit say 30 you cant hurt a squirrel with one of those    regards  ow,circlew
2335,April 2007,the nissan is out if you want real safety and real performance it really depends on the level that you expect and the balance delivered    thats total supposition    you guys are really hung up on archaic notions of safety weight does not  safety talk about 1970s thinking race cars prove time and again that you can have a supremely light vehicle that provides insane levels of protection 200 mph into concrete walls    weight  enemy of fun  weight does not  safety    id much rather be in a headon accident in an e46 3 series than a 1969 chevrolet classic yet the ole chevrolet outweighs the 3 series by probably 1k lbs,blueguydotcom

2340,April 2007,brightness its unfair to compare vette with any of the bimmers any bimmer has lots of natural rivals if it skims on creature comforts itll lose sales to mb or any number of makes most bimmers are everyday car their owners expect all the things that go with that    vette is an icon sort of wo natural rivals i guess the car closest in iconic status is 911 gm has a lot more leeway in designing vette because of lack of natural rivals plus vette is a toy not everyday car to many of its owners so they dont mind if it lacks many creature comforts or if the suspension is real uncomfy    now that new bmw has a v8 i wouldnt bet on the vette when the 2 meet on a race course,mariner7

2343,April 2007,grrr the x3looks like the perfect vehicle for me but it is indeed an suv and gets pretty poor gas mileage this gets my goat because the x3 is based on the 3 series which gets good gas mileage why car makers cant make a high clearance sport wagon with good mileage i dont know the mazda cx subaru xt the acura and the x3 are really what i want but i require 25 mpg not 20 this is for emissions reasons not cost i only drive around 7000 miles a year and use the car for road and camping trips not commuting    suvs are allowed higher emissions per mile so the pollution is not just correlated with the gas mileage the only suv i would consider is the ford hybrid but it is the four letter f word ford,edwardsf
2344,April 2007,i am curious why you did not get the 325 wagon i can stash two mtbs in my saab hatch and think i would grumble if i had to cdodge my bike into 325 or audi trunk i do remember getting flack when i had a subura subaru wagon wheres the babyseat but the utilty seems worth the american mindset that sedan is sporty and salon is dorky,edwardsf

2349,April 2007,i havent seen any awd4wd vehicles whose mpgs are as good as their fwd or rwd counterparts theres just too much friction loss in the additional drive wheels one example which doesnt look like too much of a difference is the current infiniti infiniti which comes in rwd and awd versions  epa cityhighway rwd 17 mpg23 mpg awd 16 mpg21 mpg looks like highway mileage suffers more,pv2
2350,April 2007,epa cityhighway rwd 17 mpg23 mpg awd 16 mpg21 mpg looks like highway mileage suffers more    awd in a entry lev lux perf vehicle seems like an unnecessary feature in some parts of us such as la vegas frisco fl gulf states etc wonder what sales there are for awd vs snow belt states,xrunner2

2353,April 2007,um er i live in socal and am getting a audi the reasons are 1 audi wagons are only offered with audi and are thousands less than bimmer wagons 2 kdfyx points out the very real difference in handling between audi audi and fwd and 3  gas mileage is still better than almost all in its class 2231 for a audi sedan vs 2230 for bmw rwd    that said i agree with your point but it is not just limited to cars that offer fwd or rwd you point applies to all suvs in la or florida why do you need a 5000 lb 4wd vehicle because they can status of course,edwardsf
2354,April 2007,bear in mind that the vast majority of suvs are not 4wd because thats significantly more expensive  most people cant tell by looking whether youve got it or not    as nearly as i can tell the suv craze is driven pardon by people who want to sit up higher in a heavy vehicle thats well thought of by others as opposed to say a minivan nothing in there about actually using it for anything,cdnpinhead
2355,April 2007,bear in mind that the vast majority of suvs are not 4wd    are you kidding surprise    the vast majority of suvs do not even offer a 2wd version  at least not the mid to higher end models american made ford ford chevrolet chevrolets and some of the miniutes maybe but nothing that i have ever looked at seriously from japan or germany that was a mid to full size and mid to upscale suv comes in a 2wd version the closest i recall was the honda honda when we were acura shopping but the largest dealer in the dc area claimed to have never seen a 2wd one at his dealership    id be willing to bet in my neighborhood of dc you would find 100 4awd suvs before youd find a single 2wd one,habitat1
2356,April 2007,no argument about socal and status most suvs are just tall station wagons they serve no purpose for most people beyond allowing someone to say weve got an suv    audi wagon in my eyes is more expensive but then i wouldnt buy a bmw off the lot  save for the bmw i prefer audis fwd to their intrusive and easytobind awd system like bmw bmw i think audi makes driving a chore,blueguydotcom

2358,April 2007,are you kidding    uh no when we bought our nissan a few years ago 2004 the last year it was made in japan the nissan stores here in az where there are lots of offroading opportunities that surely demand 4wd were full of 2wd versions  id say there were maybe 2030 of the nissan  nissan with 4wd    in snow country im sure 4wd is more common but the allup oldschool shift the transfer case yourself into 4wd hi or lo range suvs i see around here as well as most pickup trucks are rwd btw im not talking fulltime awd here with a center differential but 4wd thats used only when you ask for it that shouldnt be used on dry roads,cdnpinhead

2364,April 2007,i would guess porsches awd system are acceptable as well here is a comment regarding the 03    the c4s offers all the plus factors of the more expensive turbo but without the added hassles of the auspuffer the 36 liters power output of 320 ponies is more than sufficient to merge in any kind of traffic and threedigit cruising on the right roads is where a thoroughbred like the c4s feels most at home the main selling point of the c4s comes down to one simple point the handling characteristics are nothing short of phenomenal for a car the size and weight of the c4s to perform in the manner of a lotus 7 and do it in comfort is a huge achievement after all we live in a world where allwheel drive is more of a catchy sales slogan and falls empty with what it promises not the c4s the allwheel drive makes a strong case that all 911 variants should send power through all four wheels    probably not the purest but ok for a daily driver    regards  ow,circlew

2366,April 2007,the audi only weighs around 130lb and diff in mpg is about 2 mpg but both cars mpg is way higher than competitors anyway besides the bmw    what competitors besides the bmw are you referring to    i had an audi audi 30 quatro for a loaner car last summer and the gas mileage was terrible on a mostly highway 250 mile roundtrip that i was doing at the time i only managed 24 mpg with the audi my acura tl 6speed averages 2829 and my 911s cab averages 2526 on the same route  conditions,habitat1

2369,April 2007,you already said that and i already er explained how you may have been off base shall we do this again sure why not it is 130 lbs heavier you are correct on one out of three sir however the car is not more expensive than its competitors is 250 328 tl pontiac5 especially when leasing the audi is only 800 more than a fwd but that is countered by higher resaleresidual as confirmed by people on this forum that have driven the two cars the audi handles better due to 1 its grip  even on dry pavement and 2 its elimination of torque steer my understanding is that in certain race classes the racing organization has prohibited audi due to some advantage it gives over other vehicles    you may be a member of the lighter is always better church and that is understandable  my 1973 capri was more tossable than todays cars but if you go out and do a long test drive with both if you are like most driving aficionados you will certainly like the audi more than the fwd,edwardsf
2370,April 2007,however the car is not more expensive than its competitors is 250 328 tl pontiac5    no its more expensive than a fwd audi thats how its more expensive i dont give a hoot what the is g or bmw cost with awd    the audi is only 800 more than a fwd but that is countered by higher resaleresidual    thats the same ludicrous argument people use for adding any option to a car you add 1400 for leather youre lucky to get back 800 automatic is about the only option that holds its value well even then like audi at detracts from the enjoyment of the car    as confirmed by people on this forum that have driven the two cars the audi handles better due to 1 its grip  even on dry pavement and 2 its elimination of torque steer    driven both of them too i loathe audis awd system ditto bmw horrific bmw one more time for subarus nasty system ive not touched a lexusinfiniti with awd so i wont comment on those but the audibmwcooby systems bind and interfere with the performance of the car in a way i dont enjoy they make driving a chore    but if you go out and do a long test drive with both if you are like most driving aficionados you will certainly like the audi more than the fwd    i dont agree been there done that and id rather walk than drive a hamstrung awd audi or bmw im not going to pay extra for extra weight less involving driving and poor gas mileage gas mileage drops from 2334 to 2231 with audi a difference of 160 a year in gas expenses for me the choice is lighter less complex more efficient more fun,blueguydotcom

2379,May 2007,your perception that the generation 4 nissan 19951999 was higher quality than later generations is absolutely true they were the last to be built in japan in the case of my 1995 w 155k miles with a good wash and wax its finish looks better than just about any 23 year old american product and unfortunately probably better than my usbuilt tl will look at 56 years if i keep it that long    rocky i would put my 1995 nissan se 5speed as a relatively better car for its era and the price than my 2004 tl 6speed no doubt the tl has a lot more gizmos dodads updated interior etc but when it comes to long term reliability and structural build quality i think the 4th generation nissan especially the 19951997 model years were exceptional far superior to their competiton of that era  us built toyota and honda  and better than the tl of that day i would even say fwd notwithstanding  that they were competitive with the 189 hp bmw in performance unfortunately nissan screwed up the current nissan so horribly that it bears no resemblence to the 4 door sports car of 1995,habitat1

2382,May 2007,in my experience driving the rwd line in a fwd car gives you abundant understeer as you try to apply power while cornering you cant accelerate and turn in a fwd car like you can with rwd so the key to fast lap times with fwd is to keep the steering wheel pointed straight as long as possible through the corner imagine the peak of a triangle superimposed over the corner to illustrate minimal time spent turning the entry side of the triangle is longer and bends deeper into the corner because youre trailbraking more traction in front and even some oversteer in a more neutral fwd car the exit side of the triangle is shorter and arrow straight so you can get on the gas sooner and harder    youre going to have to show me how to do this sometime,johnny420
2383,May 2007,i totally believe habitat as the 90s nissan were rock solid imho somewhat sporty could take a beating and maintenance was infrequent and very cheap    maybe carlos ghosn cut back on engineering and quality of parts to cut costs nissan was a good engineering company in past which was great for us enthusiasts but perhaps they did not price cars to recover costs properly they were at price levels to compete in their segments but costs got out of hand    interior and dashboard of our 97 se looks feels very good after 10 years original exhaust sys also with 181k miles mentioned 97 max paint before and think that its shinedepth just as good maybe better than our 04 07 tls changed air filters a couple of times other times dealer does along with oil trans oil plugs etc and remember that i was impressed about the sound engineering of the parts assoc with attaching the filter have always done my own brake jobs pads rotorscalipers as reqd and was pleased in the engineering done there also    and the famous v6 engine still runs strong miniscule oil consumption and sounds great on acceleration kind of a low growl nissan somehow got rid of this growl starting about year 2001 sometimes think the sounds coming from 97 max engine are more funenjoyable than that from the 0407 tls    have not test driven a pontiac5 if they use vq v6 in that car does engine have a nice growl on acceleration or has it been muffled as on the recent maxs,xrunner2

2394,May 2007,besides that lexus is just not into manual sick i think there is another reason why we wont see a manual on the lexus anytime soon thats out of all the markets lexus is in lexus is only being offered in na and japan in other markets    china lexus  europe lexusis220d  korea lexus  taiwan lexus    in na the lexus only accounts for about 30 of the total is sales dont know about japan it is just simply not profitable for lexus to drop a manual tranny in it i guess dont get me wrong i would love to see a manual in the lexus more than anybody but i guess to lexus it is a business decision rather than an emotional one oh well thats lexus for ya    now why wont the isf get a manual is totally beyond me,louiswei
2395,May 2007,well doesnt porsche have a ellps in the woodworks    well maybe without the e part    also consumer reports begs to differ with you i believe with many a black dot on porsche  toy 16 audi tts audi awd commuter 17 volkswagen volkswagen alltrack se 4motion awd wifes 16 kia kia chrysler 16t fwd,andres3
2396,May 2007,no porsche has a performance sedan coming but its gonna be a monster in the same vein as a cls    andre do a little research on porsche they commonly in the top  if not top,blueguydotcom
2397,May 2007,well i think i will because if i ever win this state lottery a porsche dealer will see me within the next week        i think porsche would be the first dealer id visit if i won the big one in the lottery although an rs4 or r8 wouldnt be bad shades  toy 16 audi tts audi awd commuter 17 volkswagen volkswagen alltrack se 4motion awd wifes 16 kia kia chrysler 16t fwd,andres3
2398,May 2007,well i think i will because if i ever win this state lottery a porsche dealer will see me within the next week    thats what i thought about 15 years ago but fortunately i neither wasted my money on lottery tickets nor on buying and trading ellpss every 34 years    im not suggesting to anyone that they run to the porsche dealership and cross shop a 911 with a bmw or lexus however consider what your money bought you 15 years ago in 1992 base msrps    16865  honda honda chrysler  19995  nissan nissan gxe  23275  bmw 318i  24340  acura acura  25385  infiniti bmw0    67750  porsche c2 coupe  76750  porsche c2 cabriolet  86780  porsche c4 cabriolet    as you can see even a base 911 in 1992 ran 3 times the price of a base 3 series back then 25000 was a heck of a lot to spend for a sedan    now 15 years later in this ellps forum we are all discussing entry level cars in the 35k to 50k range a well equiped bmw runs twice what a 318i ran in 1992 arguably the bmw is twice the car of a 318i but the dollars have still doubled except for porsche the base c2 coupe runs 72800 a mere 5k and 7 more than in 1992 not to mention that now porsche dealers will even discount they didnt have a german word for that concept in 1992 my dealer recently sold a reasonably optioned brand new 911 c2 for 69000    like i said im not advocating the 911 as a potential replacement for the family sedan but relative prices have changed a lot it wasnt that long ago 1994 when i bought a 1995 nissan se for 21000 and nearly had an anxiety attack trying to justify to myself the extra 3000 it cost over a 4cylinder nissan gxe now 3000 is barely the cost of a navigation system or mark levison sound system    want a porsche 911 in a decade buy a honda honda now and keep it for 10 years put the difference that you would have spent in your future fun account no lottery tickets needed,habitat1
2399,May 2007,damn you and this 70k porsche listen man im supposed to get married and have puppies and junk im supposed to be responsible i see 70k brand new porsche and i get visions of stopping by the doctor for a quick snip sorry honey no kids but we can get a 911 brand new,blueguydotcom
2400,May 2007,blue dont give up the good fight just reading into your posts and based on your passion just have patience the ultimate will come for you no doubt    i can envision a porsche in your hands however it would make the corners of your mouth reach for the stars    regards  ow,circlew
2401,June 2007,last time i checked when a car retails for a certain amount that pretty much means msrp not street prices    not always msrp is a figure the car manufacturer determines the car should retail for its a given number that in the real world has little meaning due to rebates and discounts and haggling and leasing and  tradeins etc  but msrp is set by the manufacturer not the dealer what a car actually retails for can be very different than msrp  msrp in not an arbitrary number,stevecebu
2402,June 2007,i am considering purchasing certified 03 e320 or a 04 c240 from a local dealer in louisville the e320 has very low miles 24k while the c240 has 36k the price difference is about 5000 but i am torn as to whether to go with a new model with average mileage or the older model with low mileage this would be my first luxury car purchase any thoughts out there,ggrif
2403,June 2007,while neither car is my cup of tea i think the e class is a much more substantial car than the c class unfortunately both have had their share of quality and reliability issues in the years you are considering but my marketing directors former 2002 e300 turbodiesel felt like a true luxury car  quiet solid nice interior her assistants c240 was imo noisy less solid feeling and a downscale interior by comparison i do not think of the c class as a luxury car    whatever your decision i would not put much value in 36k miles vs 24k i would actually rather buy a car that has been driven regularly with a good mix of highway miles than one only used for short hops i have 155k mostly highway miles on my 13 year old nissan nissan and it has less mechanical wear and tear than cars with 13 that mileage driven mostly in the city,habitat1
2404,June 2007,another big difference  room do you expect to carry 4 adults any distance no can do in c,texases
2405,June 2007,thank you your comments are very helpful since the eclass is a local car it will be easier to dermine how the car was driven before it was turned in,ggrif
2406,June 2007,well thats another thought i will probably have occasions to do so but not often but its certainly a fact to consider,ggrif
2407,July 2007,i just read some posts that aluminum trim gets really hot in the summer now that i think about it that makes a lot of sense did i make a mistake ordering my car with black interior and aluminum trim should i have gone with wood instead and maybe gray interior the wife hates the wood but id rather not fry in the summer,dan12
2408,July 2007,in my experience yes it does  17 ford crew 27 67 coronet rt 14 towncountry limited 09 lsubaru hse 44car history and counting,qbrozen
2409,July 2007,i think a bigger factor in heat is the black interior not the aluminum trim my prior car was a 2003 cls with black interior and theres a noticeable improvement with the lighter interior on my 2007 tls no noticeable heat on the carbon fiber or silver interior trim you might want to try a front window shade if its parked in the sun,pv2
2410,July 2007,no noticeable heat on the carbon fiber or silver interior trim    i believe carbon fiber is not known for retaining heat however and is the silver trim you speak of aluminum or painted plastic    the only car i really had a problem in was my 350z the aluminum shift knob was barely usable on a real hot day if the sun had been beating on it    you are right of course that a sunshade can help but the aluminum will not absorb any less of the suns rays in a lightcolored interior  17 ford crew 27 67 coronet rt 14 towncountry limited 09 lsubaru hse 44car history and counting,qbrozen
2411,July 2007,like you say most aluminum trim is paintedplatedwhatever plastic so no difference there but a solid metal gear shift knob will fry you had one many years ago you could take an appropriatelysized foam coffee cup to slip over it to keep the sun off but it would still heat up the problem with metal is not that it gets hotter everthing inside will get to about the same temperature except for whats in the sun but that it conducts heat so well so it can deliver all that heat rapidly to your hand unlike plastic so the black interior will be the bigger factor go to the max on legal highquality window tint for the side and rear windows i wouldnt do the front if you dont mind the reduced night vision and get a good removeable widow shade,texases
2412,July 2007,many cars with aluminum trim bmw and cooper s  so yes its real aloominium and ive never noticed them as hot to the touch,blueguydotcom
2413,July 2007,real aluminum doesnt retain heat it repels it ok repel was the wrong choice of words thats why aluminum is used as heat shields on cars etc i have a car that has real aluminum trim and it the trim is never hot to the touch it maintains a relatively constant temperature in hot or cold with direct contact heat will pass right through aluminum with indirect contact it just bounces off    i usually will pull aluminum foil straight out of a hot oven with my bare hands because it doesnt hold the heat of the oven as long as you dont grab it where the hot food or cooking pan is youre fine,tayl0rd
2414,July 2007,aluminum does not repel heat  the fact is that aluminum is a fantastic conductor of heat    what this means is that if aluminum is placed near a heat source it heats very quickly and holds its heat  once the heat source is removed it cools quickly as well    the reason you can hold the aluminum edges from the oven is because as you open the oven door the heat source is removed hot air leaving oven and replaced with cooler air  you can then hold the edges because the aluminum has cooled in that area  if aluminum repelled heat aluminum oven bags would not work    aluminum trim in a car can and will become very warm to the touch if the source of heat is constant like a very hot interior caused by the sun  once the interior cools the aluminum should cool as well as long as the material behind the trim has cooled as well,scottm123
2415,July 2007,i currently have a 04 325i and before that had a 98 audi both excellent cars imho my wife is now shopping for a car and wants something no larger than mine and preferably a bit smaller but practical what we are seriously looking at is the audi audi which is quite nice with the 20t and dsg tranny    i had some hope for the 1series but was surprised that theyre just bringing it in as a coupe for us a car that size is not very practical unless it has the extra space that you get with the hatch style so the 1 is out and the audi might be in for us but were also waiting to see what they do with the opel astra when it comes here later this year with a saturn badge on it,gordonwd
2416,July 2007,weve got an 06 audi with dsg its a great car and were extremely happy with it so far,blueguydotcom
2417,July 2007,im looking at a new bmw 3series sedan with the aluminum trim i have no idea if its covered with plastic or anything else it sure doesnt look like it is but there is a bunch of it both on the dash and next to the gear shift i hope bmw is smart enough not to plaster a car with material that will fry you especially right next to the gear shift where you are likely to put your hands    anyone have experience with the 3series specifically,dan12
2418,July 2007,yes my 2006 330i had aluminum trim never got hot to the touch and it was the real deal the lame gearshift does not have aluminum,blueguydotcom
2419,July 2007,congratulationshope you continue to enjoy it,kdshapiro
2420,July 2007,its the fiancees car but yes we dig it its a nice shift from the cooper s  quieter roomier softer and obviously able to swallow more stuff,blueguydotcom
2421,July 2007,im deciding btwn a bmw 3xiauto the audi audi and the lexus is 250 awd i dont want or need all the bells and whistles just the basics ie leather power seats etc what packages should i ask for does anyone have any information that could lead me one way or another the lexus seems to be more expensive and the dealers here dont budge a lot with pricing i need to hear more peoples opinions also does anyone know when bmw plans to change the body andor design i dont want to end up buying a car to have the entire design change a year later thank you and i look forward to hearing from everyone,das107
2422,July 2007,heres a 328xi with leather zsp  sport package for the best seats ive experienced this will give you no frills in comfort for 38513 edmunds    you will not be disappointedi drive the 06 330xi and loving it    regards  ow,circlew
2423,July 2007,i think das107 has specifically asked for auto tranny so thats extra 1250 for the bimmer without the sport package i dont think he asked for it one should be able to get it for around 37000 at sticker    lexus awd around 35000 at sticker    audi audi 20t audi around 32500 msrp,louiswei
2424,July 2007,a 328xi auto with just the basics iepower seats you think will cost me 37000 that is higher then the dealerships quoted me i really want to know peoples opinions comparing the 3 different cars the audi 20t audi 08 is changing the place of the axel i think please correct me if i am wrong for the money which is the best car i dont drive a lot and dont drive long distances i live in the city and drive to and from work,das107
2425,July 2007,if you live in the city skip xiawd i do not think you need it unless you live in a city like buffalo bmw as equipped 35135 snow tires in winter for another 600    regards  ow,circlew
2426,July 2007,ive driven them all recently 1st the bmw  everyone claims it is unequaled in handling who am i to argue the steering is very weighty possibly too much at low speeds for some it does manage to feel very tight and extremely smooth all at once definitely the drivers car but if youre on city streets the whole time you might never notice lousy cupholders  average interior layout but the backseat is surprising decent 2nd the lexus  i like it less each time interior is superb but i find it overly cdodgeped even up front theres no place to set your phone down its also slow and those are two bad strikes i did think it had good steering weight handles fairly well and cornered flat to me i liked the audi best its not really any bigger but it feels less cdodgeped the little four banger is plenty quick and gets great mpg my only problem with the audi  its tired looks like its been around forever especially the interior which is the same one from like 1999 and will be replaced by a the newer better model inside of a year so its out for me personally im gonna get a used audi hope this helps these things helped me make my decision,snakesndafield
2427,July 2007,lousy cupholders  average interior layout    lends credence to the fact that people do care about cupholderslol disagree about interior its to my liking and not as busy as some other interiors,kdshapiro
2428,July 2007,dude ive gotta toyota what circlew said i lived in and around the chicago area for well over a decade and i cannot for the life of me understand why you want to waste your money on an awd system that you arent going to use    save your money get a few extra goodies and be happy    best regards  shipo,shipo
2429,July 2007,id be worried that an lexusawdat might be a bit slow lot of weight small engine  at just not what id want to spend that much money on for a car that aspires to performance but driving is the only way to tell,texases
2430,July 2007,agree about the interior i didnt notice how lousy the cupholders are during my test drive since i dont use it much anyway however bmw interior is the worst out of the 3 imo its justtoo plain i know simplicity is good but there is a difference between simplicity and plain interior wise all 3 have similar quality and fitnfinish its up to each person to decide which style suits himher the best,louiswei
2431,August 2007,i do care about the 2mm of dishing on my rotors after 20k then a dealer cost of 600 for new ones    600 for lexus rotors thank goodness for the internet huh    cars today have more hp and weight than ever before and brakes have to perform much better than they did just a few years ago the dishing of the rotor great photo by the way is typical on most european high performance cars  my wifes 04 volvo station wagon had about that much lip on the rotors at 20k miles im at 50k miles now and still going    its not a defect or damage  the pads and rotors are engineered to work together to provide both cold initial bite and high temperature fade resistance a tall order for a 3500 lb luxuryperformance car dusty pads and softer rotors are what it takes to deliver top of the line performance and safety    change the formula if you like ebc and centric but only with the understanding that aftermarket suppliers may not know better than the factory engineers what works best on your car in all situations cold hot wet high speed down hills absdsc etc also how much rd did ebc and centric do with your particular car with each other sure your brakes will likely perform just fine you probably wont even detect a difference but they will no longer perform to oe standards,fedlawman
2432,August 2007,with all due respect i dont think your experiences with bmw are typical or the penalty you are willing to pay for personal priorities is necessary    id say the experience is directly in line with all of my coworkers friends and familys experiences with bmw from replaced trannies at 25k miles to bad hvac to replaced window regulators the stories of woe with bmw are constant around my office friendly circles and family gatherings everybody i know personally with a bmw  well over 15 people  can point to at least one catastrophic failure of their car while under warranty one guys smg wouldnt go into reverse my broinlaws 3 series manual went out at 25k miles another buddys automatic required a rebuild at 50k miles another bmw driver had constant issues with his mirrors bubbling and distorting etc constant niggling problems dealer inefficiency and poor quality controlcomponent engineering are the order of the day with bmw in my experience i live in socal  they give away bmw with a latte at starbucks and thus the pool of people is quite large    these are law partners doctors and corporate execs that dont have the time or tolerance for such bs even those that drive bmw and bmw    same circles types of problems listed above    you can have your cake and eat it too today i sincerely hope your experience with your audi and mini prove you wrong and youre not without them for 2030 days annually because if i wasnt willing to accept that kind of trade off on a 911 you sure as hell shouldnt have to on them there are plenty of other good choices in their categories    1 i expect it so far im ignoring problems in my mini engine hesitation in the morning hvac blows hot air  2 i dont think there are many good choices available in any of the segments beyond bmw there isnobody else id buy in the sedan world period full stop the other cars in its segment are just plain lame the audi won out because it offered a compact fun powerful semiluxurious wagon form an anomaly in todays world of cuvscrossovers mini got me for the same kinds of reasons  compact powerful semiluxurious and most importantly a hoot to drive closest thing to it is the volkswagen and thats all    i dont see the big deal in giving up a car for repairs a few times a year turn it in get a free rental or just go home and use an extra car shrug for driver fun i see that as a fine tradeoff,blueguydotcom
2433,August 2007,for driver fun i see that as a fine tradeoff      imo you are closer to my feeling than expecting no failures the reality is all cars will break even porsche so get as much pleasure as you can but expect the inevitable as long as i get a free loaner and the repair is free in the last case a bmw i am good that to me is valuable after the driving experience    the bottom line for me in todays auto world is getting the best package you are looking for and there is not a whole lot of choice if you expect top performance in a given segment and plan your repair plan redundancy strategy and when you feel you should replace the car exit strategy    in habitats case the 99 nissan is a good example of a redundancy plan    in your case getting out of the 330i lease early was your exit strategy    regards  ow,circlew
2434,August 2007,good memory but actually its a 95 nissan and inasmuch as its sitting at our second home 375 miles away it doesnt do much as a back up i do have a 2004 tl but im considering selling it and bringing back the nissan    maybe theres something in the engine oil out there in southern california but the bmw experiences of my friends and colleagues back east have been pretty good maybe not quite up to lexus in problem infrequency but comparable or better than lexus if and when something serious goes wrong my former boss put 120000 miles on his 1997 bmw and never had a major repair retired moved to laguna niguel bought a new audi s4 convertible and has had nothing but problems in the first 18 months    ill admit that although driving pleasure is very high on my list im not going to turn a complete blind eye to reliability and the potential for costly repairs i had a chance to steal a ferrari 328 at the time i got my s2000 and couldnt bring myself to pull the trigger on a car that runs 2k for a tune up and lots more for repairs as ive said many times the fact that my 1995 nissan gave me 155k of trouble free miles contributed to my financial ability and guilt free conscience to buy a 911 also i always pay cash for my cars and expect to be able to keep them for 100k miles whether i choose to or not    blueguy not that its any of my business but if driving pleasure iswas padodgeount to you and you are a two car family why not one of the two cars you already have  take your pick  and something like a honda s2000 i can understand why a single person might not want a 2 seater sports car as their only car but for a couple to have two compact fwd cars seems a little redundant not that each isnt a great choice by itself but i think one or the other with an s2000 would be a better driving pleasure portfolio feel free to tell me to pound salt  im not trying to pull your chain im just curious,habitat1
2435,August 2007,blueguy not that its any of my business but if driving pleasure iswas padodgeount to you and you are a two car family why not one of the two cars you already have  take your pick  and something like a honda s2000    weve got 3 cars for two of us i flirted with a mx5 we get splan pricing but my fiancee chevroleted that she would never ride in it with the top down ditto the s2000 z4 z3 boxster no point in going convertible in san diego if i cant use it 247    but for a couple to have two compact fwd cars seems a little redundant not that each isnt a great choice by itself but i think one or the other with an s2000 would be a better driving pleasure portfolio feel free to tell me to pound salt  im not trying to pull your chain im just curious    i would agree and i wanted a small rwd no such thing exists in compact coupesedan form also knowing that we are going to start a family in 0910 i had to get a daily driver that i could flip easily  the mini stands apart chevroletly because its fun bmwengineered and it has astounding resale in 0910 i should be able to part ways with it and avoid the 4050 drop of cars that dont hold their value very well like my bmw for for instance at the point when i need to sell ill get something roomier alas the 1 series wont come as a hatchsedan here subaru bmw wish it came as a wagon or maybe the new audi avant,blueguydotcom
2436,August 2007,who shot jfk     rofl    i bet you think that we attacked iraq because of 911    as i said before the lexus zealots would say anything as to not let the reputation of their precious car maker be damaged i have said that i had a good experience with bmw and have used it for contrast but more so than that i would have to say for me anything but lexus give me a honda volvo whatever but just not lexus because the company is shady    as for the other forum you did not get to see the whole story and all of the postings that edumonds removed based on negative coments about lexus in a lexus forum you cant have that when they are your advertisers as for sylvias comment how exactly can i prevent people from posting you said give others a chance to talk if i had the power to control someone elses website i would post the truth right on lexuscom and not bother with edmunds    if you believe like edmunds does that the cost of maintanece and how that should affect your buying decision my point in that forum is not a factor for the purchase then you know nothing about buying a car    or    maybe you work for lexus you seem to pull facts out with every posting breaking down any dissentients comments line by line if it walks like a duck if the pharm company lobbists can out number congressmen 4 to 1 why cant an auto maker put an employee in forums to provide disinformation for potential buyers    before you do your rofl dance just remember this one i said any car but lexus so that clearly makes me impartial but are totally lexus zealot all the way you seem like a logo buyer    and btw this proves that your information is bs lexus awd does come with runflats and that is why they couldnt patch them    and lastly why when i am posting my viewpoint and experience do you have to so acuraously rebute line buy line that my personal experience is wrong it is my experience not yours and not jd powers and not edmunds its mine like i said either lexus zealot or a fourm lobbist for lexus which is it maybe you should look in the mirror,dontbuylexus
2437,August 2007,you probably wont even detect a difference but they will no longer perform to oe standards    this is true so many and i cant begin to count want to make it a major performance issue that would be true if i was racing my is but i am going to work and back and the high friction system might stop faster no more than 2 feet but in the real world with consumers the weakest link by far is the person between eyes to brain to foot that could be many car lengths so to spend 600 that is for the front system rotors and pads at the dealer for 2 feet is not logical this is setting the dust asside which can be annoying but not as much as an empty wallet    also lexus did threaten me that not continuing on the 600 every 20k miles by putting aftermarket would not only void the warranty for those parts understandable to me but anything associated to them unacceptable to me i took this as them making a case that my rear brakes are now not covered because they are part of the entire braking system which was void by the front nonom parts,dontbuylexus
2438,August 2007,this is becoming a back and forth that is not informative nor fun    considering i point out where lexus is not as good as others  room power lexus handling  how can i be a zealot or employee    you go way beyond experiences where you state all lexus cars are bad unreliable and that the corporation is defrauding everyone    and yeah i like to use facts it is how effective debating is done  using things that can be verified i also am smart enough to realize one car does not create a trend or distort things such as the tsib to try and make it fit    i guess apple just admitted they lied since they just released an update to the iphone fixing bugs or that canon lied since they had a firmware update to my rebel xt after over a year of ownership    i dont ever rebut your experience as being wrong but i constantly rebut your logic of your experience  everyones experience it is the extrapolation of your one issues to the whole that makes no sense the same as you dismiss the individuals that say the same thing about bmw    considering i have only owned my lexus for a little over a year and have owned multiple other brands from volvo audi acura saab honda and others i traded my audi that i loved because of reliability and cost to upkeep on the lexus and have experienced better fit and finish so far with the lexus    i drive a lot and need a comfortable reliable car that also offers some fun seems lexus fits it to a tee but i miss the convertible and may ultimately end up with another one from another brand    i will wrap it up by putting it this way i had a honda honda in the 1990s that everything kept falling apart on it bought new they could never solve about 10 of the issues and they were all minor no engine failure stuff but annoyed the you know what out of me i got rid of the car for a mazda mx6 v6 fun car that should have lasted longer in the marketplace and i still think that i got a bad example from honda facts show honda makes a reliable car but mine was the small percentage that was not i guess i am smart enough to realize that i got the lemon and that someone had to did i create a grudge about honda corp  nope they just stopped receiving my money and i moved on if acura makes a more compelling car to my liking i may even go back i did have an early acura that was great prior to the honda    i have said my peace and unless compelled will move on and enjoy these forums    ps  not for this group but my company builds a lot of labs for biotechnology and i have been involved in it alot if you think that big pharma controls drug discovery than you are misinformed look at scripps research institute burnham institute torrey pines not to mention the university research big pharma actually does the least drug discovery they just purchase the science and bring it to market with some internal research as well talk to any of the scientist researching cures and tell them that they have not made the breakthrough because of pharma and they will laugh,jzalkin

2445,August 2007,different subject for a better discussion    convertibles are a great thing i had an 04 audi audi cab prior to my lexus and when the top went down  a lot of stress went out the roof    i would have bought another droptop if there was one that fit my needs 4 seats being one of them the volvo was new and they wanted full msrp worried it would drop like a rock resale value and slow saab was old new bmw was not out mercedes benz was too expensive    i figured the lexus would be my between car i would love for the rumored is convertible to be real    i also am leaning towards a hardtop even though i love the look of the rapontiacp my audi was blackblackblack  a killer in the sun of south florida but it looked great    what are your thoughts on the convertibles in this segment since it is an area that is heating up pun intended    the new audi will be a great looking convertible    ps  my audi top seperated at the rear window at 25 years and 52000 miles i mention since it is the reason i now lean towards a hardtop  please lets not talk about quality as we beat it to death over the last few days,jzalkin

2459,August 2007,i bought a new acura tl this past spring it has been very dissapointing for a socalled luxury auto it generates a great deal of noise on all highways except the smoothest asphalt roads on all other surfaces you can hear the tires hissing and slapping and wheezing very noisy    visibility to the left rear is extremely limited due to the door post when entering a highway it is difficult to get a good view of on coming traffic    entry to the drivers seat is limited on my gm sedan the steering wheel tilted at an angle to the steering post allowing easy access on this car the whole steering post tilts but it has a very narrow range if you are a little heavy in the thighs  i dont mean fat  it is difficult to slide into the seat    the forward cup holder is so deep a small container of coffee gets lost in there and is difficult to get out    i paid 30k and that was 5k too much,herbert11

2464,August 2007,i had a rental audi fwd 20t with cvt for about a week and half my impression of it is blah    first of all i dont like the way cvt shifts turbo lag is horrible the car is floaty and has a lot of body rolls steering is also on the light side which makes it drives more like a japanese midsizer than an entry luxury sedan the power is adequate enough i guess but low end torque could use a lot of improvement audi could learn from bmw about how to reduce turbo lag generally speaking the driving dynamic is not what i expected from a german car even in a fwd    i also dont see any of the legendary audi interior in the audi material used although is not cheap but not among the leaders in its segment mb bmw and lexus all utilized better materials in their own entry luxury sedans however the fitandfinish is definitely among one of the best though i believe the one i got has fake leather seats they dont feel good when touched but is supportive and comfortable during long trips    i guess next time ill test drive an audi audi just to see if the experience will be different,louiswei
2465,August 2007,i have an 07 pontiac5    my button is ilchevroletted but only on the front lock portion of the switch  the unlock portion is not ilchevroletted    wonder why that is confuse,scottm123
2466,September 2007,well i saw the new cts today i still prefer the original new one is alright just a little more bubbleous our the sides a little more rake to the roofline and lots of stuff going on up front looks like the photos i guess it is suppose to look more macho or whatever it is parked next to a stretch version of same called the sts 08 i would say the best look by far is the old cts of the three imho the interior looked way finer in quality from what i could see as they had the doors locked the exterior is silver and a bit dull i would think a red may look more sporty or a black one more sexy the front is a bit much to me the roofline front and rear deck look somehow less in per portion to the overall shape than it did before you know that feeling like something is just not flowing right maybe take away the back doors which are shorter and make it a coupe would work better and like i said maybe in red or some other color it is more exciting when people speak of stunning i usually equate that to seeing something like a jaguar sedan for the very first time heck in this case i would say a twenty year old jag is more stunning  loren,m1miata

2481,September 2007,bottom line when you have to look back 40 years as it is with the really great cars from the us imho  chevrolet firebirdetc to see real style and creativity this is the same drill from caddy imo target missed with the cts again time for a few more laps around the ring to loose weight in 09    here is an example of the one i liked the bestof course and as usual this line was axed instead of devloped perhaps the ford strategy will come to gm to resurrect eld        regards  ow,circlew

2483,September 2007,well the edsel was polarizingbut that wasnt necessarily a good thing    the last caddy i liked was the 1999 still carried remnants of the classic caddy look the mushy looking 2000 was just soooo boring there were hopes when the edge look was to come out but somehow the look was also boring and didnt look very acurated the 300c also has the slab sided edgy look but it comes off bettermuch better i think i walk past a 2007 sts in the parking lot every morning and its about as exciting looking as a checker cab finally got to the point where i could easily afford one and suddenly found i didnt want one    having said that i think the cts and not the stsreally benefited from the 2008 restyle much more interesting exterior really like the agressive front end and the interior looks much more refinedthough i have one issue aside from that hugh looking steering wheel the dual climate controls on either side of the console so if youre solo in the car and want to change setting you have to lean around to get both sides working in parallel,vic10
2484,September 2007,i guess the aztec is brilliant also      that is a non sequitur    the success of the car will be in the sales the verdict is almost unanimous that it will do at least as well as its predecessor which was phenomenal and probably better,readerreader
2485,September 2007,the dual climate controls on either side of the console so if youre solo in the car and want to change setting you have to lean around to get both sides working in parallel    i dont think so  theres an auto button there  most likely like with all the other cars ive seen the auto button gives the driver full control of the climate control system  the pass button allows the passenger to control their side  look again youll see that the pass button is ilchevroletted not the auto,scottm123
2486,September 2007,i guess the aztec is brilliant also    huh is there a very large group of people who love the aztecs looks buried in a bunker somewhere in the us because ive never met anyone who loves it    when people say a car is polarizing they mean most folks either love it or hate it the 2 poles in the case of the pontiac people either responded with eh or ew that aint polarizing  17 ford crew 27 67 coronet rt 14 towncountry limited 09 lsubaru hse 44car history and counting,qbrozen

2488,September 2007,agree on the steering wheel it looks huge    overall a better car than the 07 imo although i was never a fan of the cts more like an evolutionary design than revolutionary i guess,louiswei
2489,September 2007,the steering wheel comes in three trims one is some sort of rubberized nonsense then there is leather evidently they did the foamrubbery thing to match the leather one in sizesome of the leather interior ones dont have a leather wrapped wheel so they look like they cheated a bit    theres also a thinner one on the base model i think it looks best    pros much better car in every way inside and underneath  cons sheet metal on it is hideous in person compared to the older ones exterior only black or a very dark color serves to make it look smaller and hide the myriad of hideous angleslooks very sharp in black btw the sunroof is also a joke  its huge but still so far back that the driver cant see out of it it just creates a massive lens as its slightly curved in the wrong directionway the interior really feels awful in the summer heat with that thing beating heat down on the back of your neckright at the drivers hearrest seems to eb the focal point    the flat aluminum rims look better than the chromed as well,plekto
2490,September 2007,waitwait a minute    are you telling me that there are actually ctss that dont have leatherwrapped steering wheel are you sting me we are talking about a cadillac which last i checked is a luxury brand here right    i seriously doubt that this is true but if it is then cadillac is just being the cadillac of the old which is bad,louiswei

2493,September 2007,and as long as gm and ford sell enormous numbers of larger cars and suvs  well over half of their entire production why should they get stuck trying to make a small luxury car    every time that they have done it its been a flop andor hasnt made them a dime and only hurt their image the closest that they have come is volvo and saabs offerings    but designing to compete in the ellps market i cant blame them for running from it as fast as they can,plekto

2502,September 2007,i may be wrong but i dont think that the us auto plants of honda toyota bmw etc that are in various parts of the us have union labor regardless if i were gm i would either find a way to eliminate uaw from my plants or move the plants to mexico perhaps providing jobs in mexico would help reduce illegal immigration let the laid off uaw workers cut our grass clean our houses pick our crops etc could be a win win situation,wardm
2503,September 2007,if it were only that easy that simple    my concern is that the unions among other things may slowly force gm out of biz    the talking heads claim the union is on strike for job security    confuse    it appears the actions being taken may actually have the opposite effect  at least that seems to be one of the outcomes that could happen    here in cincinnati where the chevrolet used to be produced the gm union workers went on strike and kept squeezing and squeezing gm gm responded by saying if you keep doing this well have to shut the plant down here in norwood    then all of a sudden gm says we cant make a go of it here anymore  and all of a sudden the union in response threatened productivity    too little too late    this account is a summary is incomplete and is somewhat light on the facts since it was certainly not solely the union that killed gm here in cincinnati hamilton oh and norwood oh    the point is with over 1500 in burden per car produced we should not be surprised to see cars made by companies that have a comparative advantage,markcincinnati
2504,September 2007,i saw a report on cnbc this morning indicating that gms labor costs are on the average 30 to 40 per hour higher than their competitors at toyota and honda when you factor in all of the fringe benefits health care costs etc    now i dont mean to sound elitist but i find it excessive that the average autoworker would even make 30 to 40 per hour with benefits the vast majority of these assembly line and plant jobs do not require a college education and are nominally more skilled than the average service worker its nice to think that somebody with a high school education can punch a clock for 40 hours per week have 45 weeks of vacation a year and make the equivalent of 120150000 per year 60k80k more than their toyota counterparts but thats just a bit ridiculous when the average pediatrician with 810 years of post graduate education barely makes that    and they want lifetime job security well who the hell wouldnt with a bonanza like that,habitat1
2505,September 2007,shocking    hab this is the first time that you and i actually agree on something    surprise surprise surprise    if an engineer with a master degree working for a big aerospace company in southern california is making 37 per hour as starting salary then i think those uaw autoworkers are way overpaid    me too not trying to sound like an elitist here,louiswei
2506,September 2007,you dont sound like an elitist it makes sense that people with specialized schooling and industryspecific knowledge should be compensated more than someone who must tighten bolts or check for gaps in paneling    im pretty confident that most people working in the automotive world could not step into my job onthefly and be up to speed in a week or two flipside longshoremen and autoworkers are employed in what are traditionally considered blue collar jobs little specific education to carry out the tasks and those tasks have become highly automated,blueguydotcom
2507,September 2007,the problem is that the uaws job security essentially ties gms hands they want to get rid of the entire job bank and many parttimers to lower costs but the union wont budge    unfortunately for gm its trim the workforce or shut its doors in the us and move overseas zero other options so the uaw just effectively shot itself in the foot because gm is back against a wall with no way outand logically as a result no room to negotiate they sucked and sucked and sucked at that teat until it just gave out    gms best move at this point fire the entire uaw and hire the employees on their own termsor hire new workers they really have no other choice given how our economy is going downhill i suspect most of the workers will give in sooner or later if its a choice between accepting less money and having their car and house payments or having their pride the rest they can hire    now im personally a supporter of most unions but its a give and take scenario ive seen the uaw do noting but take for two decades or more and its finally made gm decide that opting out is less painful than negotiating i dont really blame them either,plekto
2508,September 2007,plekto    i cant think of a single union that i am in favor of i work for an organization that puts on trade shows for its constituents at various convention centers throughout the us we have to deal with the unions in most of those cities in order to set up our events productivity comes to a screeching halt because of the unions we cant even move a box from one room to another without having a union person do it and its not like they come running when you need them    i recall when i was in high school in the washinpontiacn dc area i had a friend who worked as a cashier in a grocery store he was making twice what i made at the local hardware store and got double time on saturdays and triple time on sundays and holidays it was ridiculous    around the same time fdodgee late 1970s i new of a person who lived near my aunt in gadsden alabama who made 2200 per hour sweeping floors at the local steel plant thats over 45000 in 1978 unfortunately the steel plant closed probably because of having to pay ridiculous wages and benefits    unions are choking american industry,wardm

2515,September 2007,come on compare to lincoln cadillac is like the bmw    ford should really put lincoln out of its misery    in the article seems to me that most of the performance are due to the sticky michelin honda sport sp2 tires which are found in some porsches if i am not mistaken the standard tire for the bmw is bridgestone potenza re050a rft runflat which doesnt perform quiet as well as the sp2 the bmw performance numbers should be much better with the sp2 and further distinguish itself from the cts    however one thing nobody can deny is that the cts is currently the interior standard of the segment the quality of materials and fitnfinish is just amazing but both the front and rear seats can be comfortable though    exterior styling of this car is not my cup of tea too big too edgy and too much chrome the massive grille is just hilarious looking and i doubt itll age well through time i much prefer old ctss exterior over the new one    probably not going to drive it since i have no interest in getting one but overall it looks like a solid entry from caddy i can see that itll sell well here in the states but thats pretty much it,louiswei
2516,September 2007,new tires helped my e90 tremendously    as for the other stuffive only seen pictures but to my eyes its too busy i love spartan interiors too much seems to be happening in the cts too much chromeystuff too ill get to it in 0910 when i have to buy a new car,blueguydotcom
2517,September 2007,however one thing nobody can deny is that the cts is currently the interior standard of the segment the quality of materials and fitnfinish is just amazing but both the front and rear seats can be comfortable though    i for one will deny it i found the interior to be of no better physical quality than any other car in the class poorly laid out and gaudy not my personal cup of tea    best regards  shipo,shipo
2518,September 2007,are you completely serious in your arguments or are you just trying to be funny first this was probably one of the best reviews cadillac could have hoped for it went out of its way to say that cadillac and gm had produced a vehicle that isnt saddled by the problems of previous vehicles    but what still gets my undies in a crunch is people around here directly comparing the cts to the bmw 3 series oh sure cadillac wouldnt mind some 3seried buyers cross shopping since they dont have a car in that space in america and probably wont for another 2 years but its completely unfair to compare the cts to a smaller lighter vehicle    dont believe me check out the specs between like vehicles in the class    cadillac cts  wheelbase 1134  length 1916  width 725  curb weight 3900 lbs  epa class midsize    bmw bmw  wheelbase 1137  length 1911  width 727  curb weight 3650 lbs  epa class midsize    mercedes benzmercedes benz e350  wheelbase 1124  length 191  width 717  curb weight 3740 lbs  epa class midsize    audi audi 32 nonaudi  wheelbase 1119  length 1935  width 713  curb weight 3858 lbs  epa class midsize    lexus lexus  wheelbase 1122  length 190  width 717  curb weight 3704 lbs  epa class midsize    infiniti bmw5  wheelbase 1142  length 1926  width 708  curb weight 4043 lbs  epa class midsize    now compare those vehicles to the bmw 3series    bmw bmw  wheelbase 1087  length 1782  width 715  curb weight 3593 lbs  epa class compact    the bmw 3series has a wheelbase 5 inches shorter on average and about a foot in total length shorter than all the above mentioned vehicles its interior size is a whole nother epa category bottom line is that the cts is the new 5serieseclass competitor to this space get used to it its just that the old competitor in this class for caddy the sts hasnt died yet but cadillac has already publically stated that the sts and dts will die in favor of a new large flagship car while a smaller bseries car will slot under the cts in the next couple of years    yes the cts is on the heavy side and thats been a problem for gms sigma platform in general in this class only the infiniti bmw5 weighs a tick more but they got so many other parts of the car right yes entry to the backseat is cdodgeped but frankly i dont have rear passengers often unless they are my kids    the cts is now missing a couple of major features to properly compete in this space a v8 engine option thats not a hotrod a la mseriesamgs  rsclassvseries i fully expect gm to retify that situation when the nextgen northstar appears in a year or two with a new ctsv also due on the horizon that means the sts can be put out to pasture the second major issue is body styles i already know a wagon is in the works and a coupe should be coming at some point,sevenfeet0
2519,September 2007,ive spent a few hours in this cars interior please explain what is poorly laid out and gaudy also please give an example of what is a better example of the class,sevenfeet0
2520,September 2007,also please give an example of what is a better example of the class    throw a dodge at any of the other cars from your midsize list    the bmw 3series has a wheelbase 5 inches shorter on average and about a foot in total length shorter than all the above mentioned vehicles its interior size is a whole nother epa category bottom line is that the cts is the new 5serieseclass competitor to this space     yes entry to the backseat is cdodgeped but frankly i dont have rear passengers often unless they are my kids    a little bipolar feeling today a mid size eclass or 5series isnt cdodgeped in the back for adults so regardless of what the epa says the cts doesnt compete in useable size and if all you need to do is put kids in the rear seat why would you buy a bloated 2ton not really mid size car,habitat1

2523,October 2007,i checked out the new cts over the weekend and ive gotta say im pretty impressed one caveat i didnt drive a manual so i wont talk about performancedynamics right now suffice it to say the ridehandling compromise is class appropriate with a refined driveline that has no bad manners or noticeable deficiencies    sure its not the sportiest car in this segment its far to big and heavy for that but i respect the fact that cadillac didnt try to beat bmw at their own increasingly ambiguous game    instead cadillac has built a car that has one of the nicest roomiest cabins in this class and trimmed it with high quality materials and appointments its easily the nicest cabin ive ever seen on a gm and a match in quality and layout to anything in the class the stitched seams on the softtouch dashboard covering and the wood and metallic hyundai are very pleasing i found the backseat to be quite comfortable too although as previously mentioned the footwell is tight    exterior styling is definitely too contrived subjective i know  too many angles and random acts of chrome for my tastes but again it looks modern and aggressive  even attractive  and for its part at least it doesnt look like every other car on the road i have to respect gm for trying something different and mostly pulling it off    personally i think the softer larger and heavier 3series has alienated many of the driving enthusiasts interested in this segment and it will be up to the lighter more compact 1series to win us back over bmw i dont know if the cts now defines this segment  bigger and more luxurious yet still sporty but it definitely compares favorably with the bmw and infinity on the performanceluxury continuum every car in this segment has slid way to the right on that scale over the past few years so who can fault cadillac for grabbing tightly onto the right end    what remains to be seen is whether gm can sell it in the volumes it deserves i dont think the cts will fail because of its quality styling features or luxury i think the toughest battle the cts faces is still the stigma associated with the badge it wears on the hood,fedlawman
2524,October 2007,interesting thanks    you could well be correct with your assessment that cadillac has squandered their oncerevered status could be worse though  think lincoln    either way the cts carved a decent niche with its first version and most appear to fall all over themselves exclaiming over how much better this one is    if cadillac can get even a few bmwaudiinfinitimb people to come over theres a huge cadre of buy american folks wholl drive it for that reason alone    looks to me like its going to be a winner though it does look strange  a bit gaudy for my taste such as it is,cdnpinhead
2525,October 2007,agreed    i think those of us driving enthusiasts who favor bmw are inherently opposed to gaudiness and flash unfortunately i think we are in the minority    there are many others that want a car that is sporty and luxurious yet also serves as a fashion statement style status etc    ive seen enough bmw wearing 19 chrome wheels to know that the cts will be a big success,fedlawman
2526,October 2007,  bmw wearing 19 chrome wheels      oh yes    one of the things than endeared me to the lincoln ls early on was one of the senior sales executives who would come down like the hammer of thor on any dealer that put a carriage roof treatment on an ls he was a real car guy but the dealers were as clueless as the day is long to say nothing of the people who drove lincolns in 2000  all moot these days    bmw endures much of the same though cadillac may siphon off some of the more ostentatious with the cts thats a good thing    drivers unite,cdnpinhead
2527,October 2007,i loved my lsnow lincoln is sadlygone    i agree with both fed and yourself regarding a nice package for the ctsbut the styling still alienates me not to mention the catera heritage and the stigma of arrogance from most dealers i associated with in the past in ny    i think the global enthusiasts spoke loud enough to create the 1series no doubt this will be a success in 2 wayssince the base model will attract yet even younger buyers and the 135 the crowd that craves perfection    funny thing is when i explained to my wife the 1series would come in smaller than the current bmw she was shocked that i would consider such a small car she worries i will wedge under a semi and never be heard from again    regards  ow,circlew
2528,October 2007,i think the reasonings behind bmw doing the 1 series are pretty simple and i doubt it came as backlash from 3 series owners that car still has crazy sales numbers the fact is that the bmw 3 series had grown in size and purpose from its 2002tii roots and that there was a potential model that could be inserted there now that combined with the fact that the 3 series is getting so expensive that it is pricing itself out of the hands of its youngest customers makes the business case,sevenfeet0
2529,October 2007,all these entry levels are expensive the 250 isnt expensive the 1 series will appeal to the mazda 3 and volkswagen volkswagen crowd,kdshapiro
2530,October 2007,i agree    i also think it will also appeal to the audi audiaudi crowd the mazda 6 and honda coupe crowd and perhaps most of all the bmw 3series crowd the ones that want an e46 but shopping the e90e92 because its the only game in town    itll be interesting to see if the first few months following the 1series debut has an effect on 3series sales,fedlawman
2531,October 2007,except its the size of a 5 series    not a 3,plekto
2532,October 2007,uhhh what,shipo
2533,October 2007,i think hes referring to the size of the cts    yup the cts is big but all of the cars in this segment are growing faster than the incredible hulk eventually if this segment continues its current trend all of these cars will be as big as or bigger than the 2008 cts cadillac simply went there first,fedlawman
2534,October 2007,and as the hulk gains weight he continues to expand horsepower exponentially what to do with all that energy    at least this segment has a dr banner side as well    regards  ow,circlew

2547,November 2007,before everyone bets the farm on the 135 i read an article in motortrend today that the weight isnt that much different than the 3 series and since it is very small wouldnt have a very large advantage in anything i think that it was about 200 lbs in difference i would have thought about 4500 lbs would have been the difference which would have been more significant,richardga73

2551,December 2007,its interesting and quite ironic really that the us needs to import cars like the pontiac to get the higher level of build quality for a dying brand like ive said before caddy just does not pique my interest in the least even with the new cts no bash intendedjust a personal choice btw i saw a catera on saturday and felt more pain    i once toyed with the idea of an xlr as a fun car but considering its a vette clone why not just the c6 verte the edges are not appealing imo    all the best during the holidays and happy new year    regards,circlew
2552,December 2007,and to you ow happymerry    you ever have an inexplicable car desire bricklin delorean subaru svx mine appears to be the xlr i think its the ht convertible just a gadget that has always appealed to me and overall i like the exterior style of the xlr of course i dont like some of the gmcheapness eg the plastic looking grille and well the interior indeed the issue for me and ill assume many potential xlr buyers is the price even a couple of years used the asking prices compare to some formidable new cars eg aforementioned chevrolet audi as5 and bmw 3 jag xf among others    so more than likely it will be an unfulfilled inexplicable desire probably should just save my nickels for a newcpo jag xk beeeeautiful or a maser gran turismo mas beeeeatuiful    my father in what i can only assume was a moment of insanity and charity bought a catera he was surprisingly happy with the ride and comfort unfortunately the opportunity to enjoy said ride was somewhat limited by its penchant to visit the service bay sick least reliable car hes ever owned    but recent recalls aside and can they be put aside i think the new cts is a winner especially for a gm the first cts to me was a styling abomination both outside and even more so inside but it sold so good for gm    do australianbuilt cars offer quality i thought not  13 jaguar xf possibly my favorite of all the cars ive owned but my 09 jag xk was a beauty as was my 05 acura tl 88 acura acura 84 mitsubishi mirage turbo  78 volkswagen scirocco my first and of course the 92 nissan nissan ser and 95 saab 900s i bought for the ex ok i like a lot of the cars in my life,laurasdada
2553,December 2007,my sentiments exactly lsaturnsdada never have i drooled so much over a prospective car as i have the xlr i just think its a bit cost prohibitive for me such a sexy luxury sports car though if i could find an 07 in the low 50k price range id jump on it like a duck on a junebug    so i stumble upon the cts yesterday and have been under the ether ever since what a carand over 30k less than a new xlr once all the options are added to it id already have ordered one online had it not been for a few articles ive read about this mysterious ctccoupe that might be coming out this summer now i could certainly wait til august if that is indeed the case no one seems to know for sure yetmaybe next month well find out for sure    i just wish the xlr were a bit more reasonable either way looks like ill be the proud new owner of some sort of cadillac here shortly just found this forum and enjoy all the banterexchange of info and opinions    clark,clarkster

2555,January 2008,the new hyundai puts the pressure on bmw    chassis    the car boasts a 5347 fronttorear weight distribution which comes fairly close to the coveted 5050 ratio made popular by bmw hyundai says the cars body structure is 12 to 14 percent stiffer than a bmw 5series or mercedes benz eclass despite this the unibody is lighter than that of either the bmw or e    the car is still heavy particularly with the v8 but at 30k to start bests even the cars on the ellps in many categories other than price imo    regards  ow,circlew
2556,January 2008,i doubt that those who willing pay a premium price for the privilege of being able to say they drive a bmw or mercedes benz will even be aware that hyundai has a car named hyundai if they are even aware of a car company named hyundai more than likely the hyundai will pull buyers from the hyundai who are mainly toyota wannabees and maybe from the toyota itself    if hyundai really wants to make an impact on the upscale market they need to do what toyota did with lexus create a new brand with separate dealerships manned with obsequious sales staff make the brand flawless and then wait several years for a reputation to build,vic10
2557,January 2008,the brand didnt make lexusthe ls400 did the car the brand was meaningless 20 years ago everybody scoffed at the notion of the japanese making a rwd v8 sedan that could compete with bmw and mb the lexus dealerships had nothing to do with sales the product and the price sold the lexus ls400 and made lexus into what it is today highly overpriced    euro snobs laughed at the japanese competitors and said people wanted an established brand people wanted a luxury nameplate people bought the badge and thats somewhat true of course lexus also offered a 35k v8 luxury sedan that undercut the euro competition by well over 10k suddenly luxury sedans were well within reach for people who didnt want to fork over dough for a jag mercedes benz or bimmer    the hyundai will appeal to the same folks and i really seeing it hitting infiniti lexus and acura the hardest most likely acura and infiniti will take it hard why spend 50k on an m45 or 5 series when you can get a hyundai for 40k and its decked out the same way,blueguydotcom
2558,January 2008,if lexus is overpriced then just about every other luxury brand exclude infiniti is overpriced including mb and bmw however thats another subject all together    i wouldnt say the dealership and service had nothing to do with lexus success true without the car the brand is nothing but lexus success was built on a decent car at good value the ls400 was not that good and industry leading dealership experience and service there are many folks out there who dont know what edmunds is but like to be treat like kings and queen and lexus captured them perfectly lexus may not know how to build a better driving machine than bmw but they sure do know how to make their brand luxurious and how to treat their customers right    personally i dont think lexus infiniti and acura have much to worry about with the hyundai imo the chrysler dodge dodge pontiac pontiac buick lucerne toyota toyota and hyundai own hyundai are going to be the biggest loser due to the hyundai launch    no okay very little luxury buyer is going to be attracted to a car whose manufacture is too shameful to put its emblem on the hood or grille,louiswei
2559,January 2008,the brand didnt make the car    true but lexus would not have risen to the level of acceptance as luxury as quickly if it had been called a toyota and sold side by side with toyota my opinion,vic10
2560,January 2008,the price and quality of the ls400 and q45 sold them the dealer network may have had a part in repeat sales but initially it was all about a luxury car nearly on par with bmwmbjag for a crazy deal    personally i think lexus drew in people who aspired to own a luxury car hell today plenty of people in their 20s think lexus is a luxury make i think hyundai will pull in plenty of aspirational buyers,blueguydotcom
2561,January 2008,the ls400 was not that good    actually the ls400 was that good i remember well i think i remember i was so much older then im younger than that now the reviews shock and awe the ls was very much mercedes benzlike at 12 the price the q was very much bmwlike at 12 the price but of course infiniti opted for the classic rocks and sticks ad campaign    the lesser models of lexus and inifiniti were just that lesser filler to get folks into the showroom i agree with bgdc the big dogs made the marques much less so infiniti of course they had a much longer and winding road to todays level of success    the dealer service was also a selling point i believe the late 80s early 90s were the height of the german sales arrogance that had to change  13 jaguar xf possibly my favorite of all the cars ive owned but my 09 jag xk was a beauty as was my 05 acura tl 88 acura acura 84 mitsubishi mirage turbo  78 volkswagen scirocco my first and of course the 92 nissan nissan ser and 95 saab 900s i bought for the ex ok i like a lot of the cars in my life,laurasdada
2562,January 2008,the pontiac5 came out and offered almost 3 series handling power rwd etc with a whole bunch of rough edges it saved infiniti the i35 and g20 had been huge flops because they didnt match the top dogs at anything so even for less you were getting much less the pontiac5 changed entry sport lux had the pontiac5 been priced the same as the 3 series regardless of dealer experience do you think it would have done 46k units a month the acura tl at 3235k is a fantastic deal and we know they move 57k a month would they push that many at 40k,blueguydotcom
2563,January 2008,imo the g is what makes the 3 get better ok so they added more weight but ill bet the weight issue is at the top of the to do list going forward for all of the engineers think 35 mpgnot to mention that carbon fiber and such lighhtweight componenets will become more prevalent on the lesser ellps    now the cts wants a little respect ok so lets see how many sales caddy takes away from the germans and the japanese i would suspect some interesting numbers considering the exchange rate issue    regards  ow,circlew
2564,January 2008,im talking about the first gen pontiac5 its an allusion to the impact the ls had on the luxury market the pontiac5 took the sport luxury market in a way no one had done before  at least successfully  rwd 4 door sedanmanual rwd2 door coupemanual the first gen was dirt cheap rouge around the edges and it challenged bmw and mbaudi to some bit the latest one just like newer gens of the ls got more expensive and became more refined,blueguydotcom
2565,January 2008,the first gen was dirt cheap    true and the interior looks and felt dirt cheap as well    however i do agree that we can compare the first gen pontiac5 to the 3series like the first gen ls400 to the sclass,louiswei
2566,January 2008,back when the lexus ls400 and infiniti q45 first came out i was working for a fortune 500 company and every other vp and svp started looking at them some of it was the better pricevalue they offered but at least as much of it was the fear of expensive repairs and maintenace headaches lexus gave very good luxury albeit in a boring to drive chassis  with toyota like dependability    by the way i always enjoy looking back in my old kelly blue book as to what those cars actually cost at the time the lexus and infiniti came out in 1990 but giving them a year to establish themselves here are the comparisons from the 1991 model year    lexus ls 400 41650  110 wheelbase  infiniti q45 40385  113 wheelbase  mercedes benz e300 47550  110 wheelbase  mercedes benz s420 64800  121 wheelbase  mercedes benz s560 76750  121 wheelbase  bmw bmw 43600  108 wheelbase  bmw 735i 56500  116 wheelbase    so the lexus and the infiniti were sized between the 5e and 7s classes but priced below the 5e    what is really interesting is how little mercedes benz and bmw prices have increased since 1991 their fat days came to an end after lexus infiniti and acura came to the us  and today bmw and mercedes benz are certainly not exclusively the territory of vps and above on the corporate ladder heck 16 years ago a 1992 mercedes benz sl500 roadster had an msrp of 100k more than a 2008 porsche 911s cabriolet and more than a 2008 sl550,habitat1
2567,January 2008,its not just the luxury cars the msrps of the 1991 nissan 300zx turbo mitsubishi 3000gt vr4 and bmw bmw were all in the mid to upper 30ks    considering that today 35k buys a 300hp subaru sti or bmw 135i you can see just how exotically priced those early90s halo cars truly were    on the other hand i guess one has to consider the cost of the technology back then to mass produce a car that basically in 1991 had the same performance specs as the current crop of hot gt cars for instance put the 300zx tt and 135i side by side and by todays standards the nissan still holds up in both performance and styling pretty impressive actually,fedlawman
2568,January 2008,hmm    so maybe you german fanboys ought to thank the japanese to keep mb and bmw honest by not bashing on it too much,louiswei

2571,January 2008,in relative dollar value terms the 1991 s560 would cost 113603 today the 08 s550 is 86700 base but the volvo0 is 144200    i think you are a little light on your relative value calculation your figure represents a 48 increase over 17 years 233 annual compounded cpi datea shows about a 571 increase over the past 17 years cpi    on that basis the 1991 s560 would now cost about 120600    a 1992 600sel had an msrp of 132650 or the equivalent of 196400 today and that 1992 600sel is less powerful than the base 2008 s550 the amgs are in a completely different league    i dont particularly buy the cpi however in 1991 a years tuition at my alma mater was 13100 in 2008 it is 35500 a 170 increase even with the current housing market funk my house is worth at least 3 times more 200 increase today than it was worth in 1991,habitat1
2572,January 2008,ok im with you agreed cpi is not everyones basket of goods over the years look at computers the price insubaru is inverted between the late 80s and now and the power difference is thousands of percent over the early models    at the end of the day the competition proves useful back pre1990 caddy and lincoln were not considered competition imo    so thanks again japan hopefully the koreans can add some more muscle as we move along watch out japan    regards  ow,circlew
2573,January 2008,hopefully the 35 mpg standard gets the engineers using better materialsdesigns even at the high end plans are being drawn    mr di montezemolo also talked about the increasing need for improved fuel economy 151 even at a company like ferrari he said his company aims to reduce fuel consumption by 30 to 40 percent between now and 2013 he said while technologies like bio fuel will help boost fuel economy the biggest improvements will come from lightweight technology like carbon fiber and aluminum    regards  ow,circlew
2574,March 2008,hi  i am pretty much down to audi audi or is 250 when looking for a smaller luxury car both have excellent mileage and that was one of the main factor giving the gas prices these days  thinking of 2006 audi audi or 2005 lexus liked the interior of lexus but it is still pricey not sure which one to choose  i am trying to compare the common issues maintenance costs and dealermfg customer service levels  any help thanks,activex111
2575,March 2008,dont know if a back seat is important to you however while im only 58 when i got in the lexus and set the front seat for my body i was almost unable to get into the left rear seat trying the same thing in the audi was a breeze as there is easily two to three inches more overall leg room in the audi    best regards  shipo,shipo
2576,March 2008,weve got an audi  2006 with dsg in terms of room its far far bigger inside than the lexus we easily take 4 adults in an audi we use it to make trips to costco storage etc shockingly our 2006 has held its value really well we paid 22k for it in march 2007 and with 27k miles its still worth at least 21k the engines powerful yet the car gets great gas mileage and the dsg is still fun to play with it handles poorly but then again so does the lexus    on the downside audi service is horrible i had no idea how good i had it with bmw until i took our audi in for the free maintenance one of the passenger door lock switches blistered and the rubber came off it the scumbags at audi of america said it was a trim and normal wear piece so the warranty did not apply they said repair of the switch would be 300 seriously how awful is audi my wife swore up and down telling me she loves the car but we will never buy an audi again a 2 year old car with a blistered door switch and its not covered by the warranty thats obscene  especially when its obviously a defect not a result of wear or tear    lexus typically builds bulletproof cars and im betting the is follows suit service is pricey but rarely needed,blueguydotcom
2577,March 2008,blue how is the cooper s holdiing up have you tested or seen the 1er yet    regards  ow,circlew
2578,March 2008,try an audi on for size make sure you can get in and out of the front seat    it has a swept back apillar and the bpillar is pretty far forward i cant do it when i try to enter its like the front seat is pulled forward thought its not    if it fits its a pretty neat car  moderator    prices paid lease questions suvs,kyfdx
2579,March 2008,hmmm thats interesting i find that the audi is one of the easiest smallish cars to get in and out of that ive ever tried on for size confuse    best regards  shipo,shipo
2580,March 2008,hi  have you thought about the acura acura also the base tl may be in your price range and though its bigger the gas mileage should still be good i drive a tls and am very happy with it but gas mileage is middling good luck,pv2
2581,March 2008,correct me if i am wrong but dont you drive a bmw or bmw point being you like me are into the engine output as well    if i buy a lexus again i cant affors it  is it not true that its going to have more gadgets more power more modern interior the keyless thing among other things than a bmw thats got nothing to do with stats but is the reality the more i pay the more i need that includes power and everything else that comes with it driving dynamics is something i will define i will not let anyone else define it for me    driving dynamics is a point you can raise for the comparison btwn a bmw to a lexus there the dynamics come into play certainly not for the bmw i can assure you the driver of the lexus is going to feel pretty good smoking that bmw,sjaieve
2582,March 2008,i am not taking sides here with the bmw fans because my next car will possibly be a gs 350i just wanted to share this experience with you in regards to horsepower i had a 2003 acura tl type s which boast 260 hpmy friend has a older bmw that has 198 hp and everytime we race he was down on my tailyou would think that a 260 hp would blow the doors off 198 hp bimmermy point is its not only hp that dermines a cars speed its the torque gear ratios weight driver etc etc  another remarkable example i saw a mazda miata beat a ferrari and porsche on motorsport tv last saturdayexpalin that to me,billyperks2
2583,March 2008,also keep in mind that your question will be answered with more people leaning toward the tl being that you are asking within the tl thread  i like the tl enough that i still pop in here from time to time but me and my love for the g cant stand a chance against all these tl lovers    ask the same question in the g forum and youll get the exact opposite response    i still like these guys in the tl forum even with their less than perfect choice in vehicle p blush,scottm123
2584,March 2008,you can get a 5 series for about 67k below msrp via ed    one can probably get a lexus close to invoice now a days so thats already something like 4k below msrp    by the way does bmw pay for my ticket to germany and all the room and boards if not then maybe one should take that into consideration in order to make an apple to apple comparison which a good shopper always does    also lets not forget the rental car fee if this is your only car because i believe with ed one would have to turn in the car at the time of purchase if a tradein is involved because the car doesnt arrive until something like 4 weeks after you took delivery in germany    a smart and good shopper always takes every single penny into the consideration,louiswei
2585,March 2008,best of luck to that gs owner should the road have a curve bend hill or really anything that requires some kind of chassisathleticism,blueguydotcom
2586,March 2008,by the way does bmw pay for my ticket to germany and all the room and boards if not then maybe one should take that into consideration in order to make an apple to apple comparison which a good shopper always does    its called a vacation some people take those sadly in the us we dont get nearly enough pto my last vacation was two weeks in thailand in nov 07 before that i spent a few weeks in europe for my 06 ed whether i get a car or not another trip to europe will be in the cards    also lets not forget the rental car fee if this is your only car because i believe with ed one would have to turn in the car at the time of purchase if a tradein is involved    theres a word for someone that trades in cars on purchase barnum used itwhat is that word    a smart and good shopper always takes every single penny into the consideration    i could break all that down for you too but itll get boring needless to say frequent flyer miles are easy to create with credit cards and free hotel stays andor great deals are easy to find too,blueguydotcom
2587,March 2008,of course if the tl lover posts the facts and opinions regarding their choice of the tl over the g then it is good food for thought for those requesting information of course the buyer should do their own dd    if fanboys simply scream that x is better than y becuause motor trend and cr said so so i bought x well stay away from syms because an educated consumer is the best customer    1st gen g great car an eyeopener in munich no doubt gen 2 a lovel evolution hello 300hp 3 series lets see what honda does wnext gen tl  13 jaguar xf possibly my favorite of all the cars ive owned but my 09 jag xk was a beauty as was my 05 acura tl 88 acura acura 84 mitsubishi mirage turbo  78 volkswagen scirocco my first and of course the 92 nissan nissan ser and 95 saab 900s i bought for the ex ok i like a lot of the cars in my life,laurasdada
2588,March 2008,scottm123 i understand that pretty much everyone on this forum is going to be biased since 99 bought or plan to buy a tl but thats part of the reason why i want to hear their opinions i want to know what made them choose the tl over the pontiac5 or the lexus is im glad youre on here too because you allow me to see the other side of the coin    thanks,irvine555
2589,March 2008,its called a vacation    i usually go somewhere else for vacations other than europe also what if my car buying schedule doesnt agree with my vacation schedule    frequent flyer miles are easy to create with credit cards and free hotel stays andor great deals are easy to find too    i have frequent flyer miles too but i would rather use them for my real vacations instead of going to europe and pick up the car also i rather use my credit cards to create more meaningful incentives such as racking up thousands of dollars for my next lexus purchase    i understand that based on your lifestyle ed is certainly a good and smart option for car shopping however lets keep in mind that it may not be the case across the board for every car shoppers out there,louiswei
2590,March 2008,best of luck to that gs owner should the road have a curve bend hill or really anything that requires some kind of chassisathleticism    the gs is no bmw but itll hold its own on curvy and hilly roads    ive tried a lexus through an autox type of course before although it is a bit on the soft side but it went through the course smoothly,louiswei
2591,March 2008,naturally its personal,blueguydotcom
2592,March 2008,look at the 060  quarter mile times of the bmw and the lexus the gs is still faster i am just calling a spade a spade here    there is a general tendency for the x28i to be overrated yes its a bmw but its not the real deal the real deal is the x35i i have respect for that car its fast and if you tell me its got better driving dynamics heck i will believe you in addition you probably paid more than anyone else driving the ellps so you deserve to be faster it boils down to the more money i pay more i need argument with the kind of performance you get for the x35i the lack of other options available on other ellps becomes petty not on the x28i though,sjaieve
2593,March 2008,there is a general tendency for the x28i to be overrated    im not defending the x28 but clearly this is your humble opinion i agree specificially with regards to you you should pay more for more horsepower everybody doesnt think like that and bmw recognizes this,kdshapiro
2594,March 2008,i think that you are entirely too caught up in straight line acceleration and if thats your only yardstick go buy a subaru and be done with it there are plenty of people who would consider the x28i over the x35i and for many reason me included when i leased my 2002 530i i made the conscious decision not to get a 540i or an bmw for that matter why because the 530i was plenty fast enough for my needs wants and desires i dont constantly need to prove my manhood by blowing every slammed honda away at every light i buy the car for me period full stop the end    some time in the next year ill be buying a new car and the top five contenders are as follows  1 audi 20t 6speed sline via european delivery  2 20012003 bmw 530i sedan 5speed sport package  3 bmw bmw coupe 6speed sport package via european delivery  4 bmw bmw sedan 6speed sport package via european delivery  2 20012002 bmw 540i sedan 6speed sport package    notice that every one of those cars can be had with a biggerbadderfaster and thirstier engine fwiw the only reason why the 540i is on the list is that i really like e39s with a stick shift and lots of other goodies goodies that are often hard to find in the 530i but yet seem to be on virtually every 540i from that vintage    best regards  shipo,shipo
2595,March 2008,i was not only looking at straight line acceleration if you read my posts i also considered options available on these 2 cars and the lex comes on top subaru is not my piece of cake in fact i was in a friends 400 hp pontiac pontiac and that car is certainly not my piece of cake either although its way faster than a bmw given a choice btwn the pontiac and the bmw i would take the bmw even if its more expensive    i agree speed is not everyones concern like i said i want everything i can get for my money that includes power toys luxury i only consider cars within the ellps though thats what i drive,sjaieve
2596,March 2008,i have been driving a c6 for 3 years and i hear you about speed this car is wicked fast and i almost get tired of having to constantly monitor my speed i tend to find cars that i can follow at a respectful distance just so i will keep the speed down with the traffic flows where i live there are very few chances to really feel the speed and i have done the club racing game already i am currently looking at moving to a wagon possibly a bmw it sucks getting old and becoming more rational,jmess
2597,March 2008,actually i admitted that my main reason for buying a tls over a pontiac5 was my wifes taste that doesnt sound very fanboish to me    that being said i am very happy with my choice and i dont regret it in the least,riorebel
2598,March 2008,let us know how you like it the bmwt fascinates me because of its more utilitarian shape while still offering rwd and a manual,blueguydotcom
2599,March 2008,well sjaieve settled the discussion hes looking at cars and he prefers the straighline acceleration and plethora of gadgets in the lexus compared to the base model bmw youre in your late 20s and want a gs my late 20s werent that long ago ill be 32 in april and i didnt want anything as big heavy quiet and burdened by a slushbox car like the gs to each his own good luck  2001 prelude type sh 2015 infiniti q40 awd 2017 honda honda touring awd,nyccarguy
2600,March 2008,in my 20s i had an alfa spider a nissan ser and a miata why on earth would a 20something want to own a 4000 lb slush box landbarge like the gs    oh well whatever floats your boat grandpa,fedlawman
2601,March 2008,i really want to end this but just felt i had to respond to this if you read all my posts i said i cannot afford a lexus so i have never looked at buying one but someone posed the question if i would consider a base 5 series and i said never there are better cars eg the lexus cos it gives more bang for the buck and i dont buy base models anymore etc etc etc i drive a car in the ellps segment my money follows where my mouthposts isare we can repeat he arguments all over again but lets move on i cant convince you in as much as you cant convince me    now how about the audi or lexus comparison i still insist its a tough choice,sjaieve
2602,March 2008,like buttah    yes sir yes sir three bags full    ive owned two straight sixes in my life and both were wonderful one was in my 240z and the other was my cummins 350 i owned them both at the same time and the switch between them was interesting but pleasant    i wanted the third to be a bmw but ive bored many with my rants on rfts and the dipstick thing how far away is the sealed hood  only the dealer can open it so not for now    maybe later well see,cdnpinhead
2603,March 2008,just replaced my rfts on my cooper  did the same with my e90  and wow nice difference as for what happens with a flat the american chevrolet business card comes with free roadside assistance,blueguydotcom
2604,March 2008,pontiac pontiac and that car is certainly not my piece of cake either although its way faster than a bmw    or not well that not entirely true its 2 seconds faster for having 100 more hp,kdshapiro
2605,March 2008,agreed 100 bmw is still a much better car imo than the pontiac irrespective of the hp difference like i said i have respect for the bmw i might not buy it but thats besides the point,sjaieve
2606,March 2008,you should also ask yourself how you are going to use the car if you are going to be using it on the track vs a daily driver then ask how you drive some of these cars have very little torque and have to be revved to get average acceleration as i get older i find it more irritating last december i narrowed the choice down to a tls a pontiac5 a ctsv and a few others i went with the tls and its pretty much the perfect daily driver sure i notice the torque steer and it may only do the 14 mile in 141 but i cant really use all of that on a daily basis anyway the other stuff its amazing honda reliability compliant ride and upscale interior make daily driving pleasant the slick 6 speed manual is a joy to row and the engine has enough torque that i can dust 95 of the cars without even engaging the vtec the best part is that despite a heavy foot in the city part of my commute and a median speed of 80 mph on the freeway i still average 23 mpg i have just over 3k miles so the mileage might even get better its hard to beat this combo if it was rwd it would be even better next year they are talking shawd but i doubt it will have a manual box so my next car will probably be a 335 or similar,chirocat
2607,March 2008,oh well whatever floats your boat grandpa    yeah thats the spirit keep it up so people will just turn their backs to this board    i am in my 20s although i wouldnt want a gs5e right now but i can understand why those who does different people have different priorities you know grandpa,louiswei
2608,March 2008,yeah thats the spirit keep it up so people will just turn their backs to this board    like fed nyccarguy has been on these boards for a long time and does have a sense of humor newbie,kdshapiro
2609,March 2008,yeah thats the spirit keep it up so people will just turn their backs to this board    i like reading your posts louiswei you provide good balance around here but you need to lighten up a little    i mind my ps and qs when im at the office or at a formal social  but around here i dont feel obliged to fdodgee my thoughts and carefully phrase them to ensure i dont ruffle anyones feathers    if someone doesnt like the heat im fine with them staying out of the kitchen in sjaieves case i think he chevroleted himself quite well and doesnt need a big brother to step in    ok time to recharge my flamethrower whos next blush,fedlawman
2610,March 2008,i wasnt stepping in for anybody i just dont like what i saw thats all    to be honest there is a difference between lighten up a little and belittle the fellow posters due to different point of view maybe i had the wrong interpretation but that doesnt mean i cant voice my differences    yeah keep your flamethrower charged up because youll need it if you keep it up,louiswei
2611,March 2008,i didnt like its bucket seats    without it then its not a sports sedan you know    it lacked pickup    maybe then you should take a trip down to your local bmw dealer and try the new bmw i would like to see you repeat that same statement with a straight face afterward    nice radio though    bmw was never and still isnt known for nice radios    why am i not surprised to see buick calling the lax super a performance sedan since saturn has already called the saturn a sports sedan sick,louiswei
2612,March 2008,have you ever driven a 3series beforeunquote answeryes ive driven my daughters 2004 bmw 330i    when the car came in 2004 was it lacking i dont think so    so in my opinion the buick super does belong in this discussion    its a nose heavy fwd car with a big engine it is a highway chrysler not up to the same performance standards as other cars in this group performance is about turning the wheel also it is not entry level luxury hondaing to edmunds it does not belong in this discussion buick can call it what ever it wants,kdshapiro
2613,March 2008,why am i not surprised to see buick calling the lax super a performance sedan since saturn has already called the saturn a sports sedan sick    then the honda is a sports sedan sick,kdshapiro

2615,March 2008,the buick buick v8 may be a performance sedan as is the chryslerc however a performance sedan and a sports sedan are not quite the same thing the 300c is a bit too big for a serious sports sedan as is the bmw 7series,sls002

2622,March 2008,yes the buick chevrolet ss and pontiac are not good choices for a performance car although fwd will make them better on slippery winter highways an awd performance or better yet an awd sport sedan would be best for winter as well as all around driving    one point that needs to be made perhaps is that not everyone has the same idea of what is the best car i like my cadillac although it is a bit on the thirsty side,sls002
2623,March 2008,that was a good one there nyccarguy    nah i actually went to test drive the bmw twice after it came out i guess my expectation was too high so i didnt end up impressed the acceleration felt about the same as my lexus in sports mode and although the handling is definitely better with sports package that is but thats an easy fix with the eibach springs just got them installed last month    i guess the most important issue for me is that i still cant get pass bmw interior    i am really liking the 135i though too bad that it doesnt come with 2 extra doors,louiswei
2624,March 2008,i guess the most important issue for me is that i still cant get pass bmw interior    different strokes for different folks i have always like bmw interiors surprise,kdshapiro
2625,March 2008,one point that needs to be made perhaps is that not everyone has the same idea of what is the best car i like my cadillac although it is a bit on the thirsty side    then just be glad you dont have a 6000 sux shades    best regards  shipo,shipo

2630,March 2008,well i installed the eibach springs because i want the lower stance and better handling ive got them for almost 2 months now and i am happy so far with the performance and the look with the springs the body roll has been ddodgeatically reduced the artificial stiffness feel has been replace by a better or should i say normal stiffness feel and the steering response also improved slightly upon installation the suspension actually felt softer than the stock setup but once its settled down after couple weeks that softness was gone kind of weird but other users have also reported about this    ive lowered the front by 1 and rear by 08 its a mild drop    here are some pictures with the eibach springs,louiswei
2631,March 2008,looks sharp,fedlawman
2632,March 2008,im diggin it definitely gives the car a more hunkered down and sharper aggressive look i like the dark blue color nice background too i love that left coast weather and scenery how many miles do you have on the car now    suspension modifications are such a great way to improve your cars performance i had front  rear suspension techniques sway bars installed in my prelude a few years ago for a little over 500 they make such a difference  2001 prelude type sh 2015 infiniti q40 awd 2017 honda honda touring awd,nyccarguy
2633,March 2008,thanks nyccarguy and fedlawman the lower stance definitely gives the car a more aggressive look one thing i like about the europeans such as the bmw and cclass is that with the sports package the cars are already sit at a lower height than their japanese counterparts    last time i checked now i am at at little over 27k miles you are right about the suspension modifications and i think my next task will be adding strut and sway bars to the car,louiswei
2634,March 2008,i was wondering if someone could check my math here goes    bmw  30 mpg 36000 miles  419gal  1200 gallons  5885    bmw  23 mpg 36000 mile  319gal  1565 gallons  4993    these prices were tonights prices for diesel at an exxon station vs premium at an independent in central nj    assuming there is a premium price bmw vs bmw the diesel is a mute point    correct me if i am wrong bottom line the d uses less fuel but the i is cheaper to keep er    regards  ow,circlew
2635,March 2008,that would require the price of those fuels to remain constant for all 36k miles not likely sick plus thats only 3 years what if someone retains the vehicle longer    though i dont know if diesel will get lower than regular unleaded it probably will at some point maybe as more people get diesel vehicles confuse    brian,subearu
2636,March 2008,i just filled up with premium tonight and paid 369gal    23 mpg 36000 miles 369gal  1565 gallons  5775    of course im not sure why but i only average about 19 mpg with my little 4banger blush,fedlawman
2637,March 2008,wow diesel in san diego is 409 and premium is 379 near my house for me diesel is a savings compared to a normal bimmer about 400 a year at current levels although gas will surely get more expensive    ,blueguydotcom
2638,March 2008,well for starters when i use your numbers i come up with 5028 for the oil burner vs the almost same number you got for the gas however id submit as have others that a 1 delta between premium gas and diesel is an unusual situation at least anywhere im likely to travel    besides which i neither need nor want a bmw id buy a 20 or 25 tomorrow if they were available over here and my experiences in the uk and europe is that ill get closer to 40 mpg than 30 with either of those engines now if we were to rerun the calculation with a 050 delta between the two fuels and 33 less consumption for the diesel i think that will be a more useful number at least to me    however to support your point a bit diesel has nowhere near the demand flexibility that gasoline has the trucks locomotives heating plants and other users of diesel and similar fuels jet a for one will keep right on consuming pretty much regardless of price while passing the added expense along in the form of higher prices for whatever goods are being transported as weve already seen over the past few weeks when gasoline prices go up significantly people use less  its discretionary to a much larger extent    should be interesting to see this play out,cdnpinhead
2639,March 2008,nj has the cheaper gas but in any market the premium vs diesel price advantage makes me wonder regarding the premium cost of the d vs the i    regards  ow,circlew
2640,March 2008,from the british website  bmw has a combined rating of 422 mpg imperial  bmw is 31  thus one computes 853 gallons of diesel vs 1161 gas premuim i suppose for 36000 miles  from the aaa price for nj i get 3393 for premium and 4038 for diesel  not imperial gallons though  adjusting for the size of the gallon div by 08 premuim is 4924 and diesel is 4306    there are a number of diesel engines that are smaller and use less fuel,sls002

2646,April 2008,i146m looking for a new to me ride i don146t have to decide just now but probably sometime in the next couple of months i thought i146d post this here as well as on the 147help me decide148 forum because this seems to be a very active discussion some of the cars i am considering do fit this category so it146s not too much of a stretch what i am considering is a probably preowned bmw 325xi maybe a 330xi if the deal is right but i146m not too sure i want a turbo pontiac5x i have vpp so i might go new for this audi audi or audi i like the audi better but they146re hard to find in the northern in vicinity acura acura or maybe tl but it146s larger and i don146t like it as much i might consider the nissan coupe as well but not the sedan while i like the sedan styling more than the honda or toyota i don146t like it as much as the infinity and the nissan sedans are everywhere i don146t want to put my car away for the winter so i prefer all wheel or front wheel drive that leaves out the infinity gcoupe sigh and the bmw 3 series coupe i know several people who drive the g coupe and they either garage it for the winter or get adequate but not great driving with winter tires i prefer the security of good winter handling i haven146t completely ruled out a small suv or crossover but after 8 years of driving an exploder i146m ready for a more responsive ride i joke about the ford but with the exception of an unfortunate 147bambi148 incident i have never been left stranded no significant repairs other than normal wear and tear either it just has over 130k miles and it is time to move on to something else as long as i146m moving on i want to add some fun i won146t be racing or pushing for maximum speed but i do like the feel of a car that you don146t have to slow to a crawl when going around a curve i suppose i want to feel like i am part of a driving system rather than the occupant of a vehicle    i would consider a 20062007 maybe a 2005 as well i know the infinity was a new model in 2007 but i like the previous model as well the bmw was a new model in 2006 and i don146t know anything about the 2005 i might be overlooking something else as well so any suggestions for additional cars to consider or avoid are welcome i146m considering a manual in the bmw or audi but i didn146t like the manual in the 14507 tl i drove the clutch seemed to have a very tiny 147sweet spot148 and it didn146t help that the salesperson sneered a little when i lurched on a start i don146t know if the acura would be any better the pontiac5x is only available in an auto manual vs auto isn146t a big factor for me so i probably wouldn146t rule out an auto bmw or audi either since i146m going to continue getting older and creakier the auto might be a smarter choice just not as much fun in the precreaky years,bfluegie
2647,April 2008,you have a wide range of requirementsbut you didnt clarify the price range youre looking for or any requirement for seatingspace    im also assuming youre looking at purchasing as opposed to leasing    for coupesif you dont need back seat room very often a tt would be a nice cool coupe to have 20t fwd a new honda coupe with the i4 5spd would be very economical but look a little different than everything else im a big fan of the audi slineespecially the s5 love the torquegets priceyaudi with fwd and manual sline starts in the low 40s and of course the new bmw 1 series    4doorsif you can wait the new audi looks very interestingthe base lexus can be had with manual and it starts our at a reasonable pricethough not fwd have yet to drive i recently drove a cts doesnt get much love both high end and base manual and found them very compelling but probably not for my s    manualif youre weighing the pros and cos of a manual versus automatic you can check out volkswagens dsg last year i drove a volkswagen volkswagen fahrenheit and it was the most amazing fwd car ive driven was 27k ish    nondomestic most of you choices seem to be nondomestic if you want fwd you can add volvo s30 s40 saab 08 93 turbo x looks aggressive,ivan_99
2648,April 2008,volvo c30 is cute but quite small and only 2 doors hatch of course s40 is nice and about 3series size volvo is a tad bigger than the 3series but only a tad and gets my vote  biased owner albeit a diesel with geartronic volvo is well worth a look    saabs are rated a bit soso here in uk but are premium priced audi good in whatever size audi is about volvo size    cant comment on the others apart from volkswagen but the current ones are good,alltorque
2649,April 2008,thanks for the input ivan while i have not ruled out domestic i havent found the blend of performance features and solid feel in many domestic cars pricewise im trying to stay in the mid 30s or lower while i could afford more thats where the comfort zone starts to end and the panic zone begins the audi could get me to make an exception though seeing that beauty in my garage every morning could calm a lot of panic    i hadnt considered the volkswagen fahrenheit and i will have to check it out i have driven the dsg though in an audi audi i really liked that car i forgot the audi was heading for a redesign ill have to check that out as well the current cts looks sharp and i can get the supplier discount below invoice so i might look there as well thank you for some very good suggestions,bfluegie
2650,April 2008,thanks for the input i forgot to add in my reply to ivan99 that i might look at the volvos as well i get the supplier discount on them as well so i could get a little more car there as well i have always liked the looks of the saab 93 especially the convertible but the reliability issues i have read about have made me cautious the edmunds review posted earlier in this forum makes it seem worth a look as well im not sure about the pricing but looking is fun    thanks again,bfluegie
2651,April 2008,saab is not much worse than audi and is probably better than volvo and volkswagen  as long as you take your car to a good dealer usually a saab or european cars only dealership or a good indy you should be fine saab is more generous on warranty work too what is covered    saab is more a drivers car than volvo even a volvo salesman admitted that i went to a saabvolvocad dealership to test drive a v6 93    they have a lot of incentives if you get it at the right time you can save several thousands usually 30005000 with this economy there may be more    if you are buying a used european car you may want to get a certified one parts and services could be expensive after the warranty expired,r34

2658,April 2008,why pay 5300 more for a car that has a heavier front end takes more gasoline to propel it and has 15 ft lbs less torque  and that the torque it does have comes on at thousands of rpms higher    i had an allroad 27t and i had also had three audi cars with the 42 v8 one audi and two audis  so when it came time to order the allroad i test drove another sort of similar car an audi 27t    torque rules    and in the example above the v8 had 295 ft pounds of torque vs the v6s 258 ft pounds yet the v6 was quicker because the torque came on in the v6 at below 2000 rpms and the v8 didnt come up to full boil until north of 3500 rpms    in this case the new 20tfsi has 258 ft pounds below 2000 rpms and the 32fsi has 243 at north of 3200 rpms  this is a no brainer    the v6 imho is for the consumer who wants to talk about the 265hp v6 despite its lower torque    had audi offered the engine competing with the bmw 335 i6 turbo well that might have been a horsepower of a different color    i believe the audi 20t will be the car of choice for about 1012 months in the audi family the v6 being offered solely for marketing reasons wouldnt do to have this car without a v6 in the brochure kind of thing    i may but i doubt it regret this decision but the handling mileage and performance of the 20tfsi should be superior in cincinnati oh where it will see most of its duty it will easily top any speed limit we have in these parts just as easily as the v6 and its quickness for a while at least will be unequaled  at least until the supercharged v6 comes out in a year or so    another audi 32 certainly was an option  but the new audi will have a 110 wheel base the audi is 111  the balance rwd biased audi sport package and other amenities and luxuries in the premium plus package makes the audi 20tfsi a better choice for someone who wants cts style luxury at least and very bmw like performance and handling  in a handsome package    rationalization    perhaps  but there are just too many head to head audi vs audi test reports and reviews of this new audi to make me wonder who in their right mind would pay more for less  and that seems to make the case in favor of the audi b8 20t with all the option boxes ticked off  except acc    so well see how much under 50k this comes out to be  and hopefully i will not regret not going with my second choice the new infiniti infinitix 4 door sedan    fwiw my dealer says this car should be comparable in msrp to the outgoing model  about 2000 for the audi drive select and a few hundred more for the addition of a backup camera    time will tell  and i will share the good the bad and the expensive with yall    surprise,markcincinnati
2659,April 2008,my wife recently took a job in the cbd of cincinnati  seemed difficult for her ever get out of third gear  just no fun with the stick for her    i virtually hated my automatic 5 speed tiptronic transmissions in my previous audis  love the automatic in my 2005 audi 32 i drive some 15 miles to work most of it on i275i71 in cincinnati when i am in any fun place to drive the stick the traffic is often all tangled up    with automatics this good  i rarely miss the sticks    i did test drive a new s5  wheeeeeeeee  now that was a blast but truth be told the same pain in the butt traffic issues would apply even with that one    i have officially joined the ranks of those who while i did not kill the stick shift certainly are preventing its resurection to those of you who wont go shiftless i apologize  i am keenly aware of your pain past tense    i would have loved a 7speed dsg even more im sure  just not avail this time    also not this time torque vectoring which i would have paid extra for surprise,markcincinnati
2660,April 2008,i did test drive a new s5  wheeeeeeeee  now that was a blast but truth be told the same pain in the butt traffic issues would apply even with that one    i have to say the world is getting smaller a car like the s5 with such power but where to drive when u will be stuck in traffic confuse    congrats on your new car i want to get a car i really like the audi but i am more interested to get an suv i like the audi but i wish audi would consider yet bringing another suv perhaps a q6 in the near future my friend he is interested to get the audi but he has a big problem his decisioncan changes within a second ,bmlexus
2661,April 2008,s5but where to drive when u will be stuck in traffic    i took out an audi sline and s5 after work during rush houri was able to find enough room to get up to speed the s5 doesnt need much room    btwlove the audi delphi magneto wasnt he in spidermanor xmen suspension,ivan_99
2662,April 2008,if im open to look at a lot of different brands which near luxury sedans have the hottest lease deals for a 15k per mile lease  im open to 2 or 3 year leases but assume 3 year leases will have much lower payments so i would more likely do a 45k 3 year mile lease than a 30k 2 year mile lease    im looking for the lowest combination of total costs lease payments  maintenance and wear etc for instance i know bmw include free scheduled maintenance but many cars with sport packages and 18 performance tires can cost thousands extra in 3 years due to tires that dont last long and are ultra expensive to replace    if i were to lease one of these vehicles i would want automatic transmission premium package with heated leather seats and moonroof bluetooth must not have low treadlife 18 sport performance tires factory nav would be a plus if any would still fit the price range even with nav    can less than 450 before tax be done with 0 cap reduction on any of these cars with that equipment based on realistically available discounts in california    bmw pontiac5 sedan c300 luxury tl acura lexus are some that id like to consider,jaxs1

2667,May 2008,i thought i might need to buy a lexus for a quiet ride but i found the 3 series to be surprisingly quiet not lexus dead silence but seemed about as quiet as an es to me when i drove it regardless of what any db meters may say  i ended up buying a bmw  from inside with the windows closed the turn signals are most noticeable noise at times    httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvtaqpontiacjrzlcfmt6,jaxs1
2668,May 2008,yep its a german buick,blueguydotcom
2669,May 2008,you mustve bought one without the sport package i had a bmw loaner last week nonsport and i was also surprised at how quite the ride is and yes the turn signal is a little obnoxious ive driven a bmw sport and it wasnt very quiet at all id still buy one though amazing how much of a difference tires can make,tayl0rd
2670,May 2008,no the sport package still feels like a buick,blueguydotcom
2671,February 2010,tco has a huge problem with it    1 depreciation isnt a factor in comparing cost to fixrepairupkeep a vehicle also neither is stuff like insurance yes it matters but not to compare which vehicles are the least expensive to keep runningyou really only lose money when you sell the car if you ever do  or to be more accurate you only get back the difference in depreciation whenif you sell it    2 the first years where the factory warranty is in place artificially skew the results bmw comes out well by this measure because it does cost you nothing to keep the car running or nearly so but try that with a 5 year old bmw    tco is pretty worthless really    just looking at the data i posted  if you go back to 2005 youll see lexus is taking about half of the spots infiniti and cadillac vastly improved their quality since then and lexus slipped a bit down to where hondaacura isstill very good especially if you get a car with manual    link title    the problem is that costs to fix things is skyrocketing a replacement transmission in a toyota for instance runs over 3500 now thats just silly bumpers and other components that get scuffed or cracked are hideously expensive want to replace a toyota or bmw or well almost any cars headlight assembly    so if one company can come in with less frequency andor less cost per part than the competition it wins mercedes benz audi and bmw flatout fail here volvo is also notoriously pricey to fix acura and infiniti are a bit better as is cadillacthey take grief about not using the best newest tech but then again thats less stuff to break as well toyota just has problems recently and id not recommend anything with an automatic or etcelectronic throttle control on it from themthats 80 of their line currently,plekto
2672,February 2010,want to replace a toyota or bmw or well almost any cars headlight assembly    gives me a flash back to last year when i wrote off my q45 wasnt that bad of an accident one headlight assembly came in over 1200ouch,ivan_99
2673,February 2010,theres that chevroletion again lies damn lies and statistics you get to pick your metric and make your case based on your metric there is no getting around it the more expensive the car the more it costs to own    for example in my area a rebuilt pontiac5 tranny is almost 2k but a rebuilt toyota tranny is 700 not sure where you get your figures from a headlight assembly for a infiniti is nearly 800 ouch    if you are saying an infiniti tranny breaks less often than a toyota tranny after the warranty period you would have to point to some credible source for me to believe it not just a cr survey    but it still boils down to will your car have an issue and if it does what will it take to repair it my bmw can be cheaper to own on a parts basis against a used honda if nothing breaks on it and the honda is constantly under repair,kdshapiro
2674,February 2010,i suppose if the rebuilt toyota transmission is a generation or two old and has no warranty and is out of some shop in the middle of the industrial section of town you might find one for 700 but here in los angeles a 45 year old toyota automatic is well over 3000 by the time you write the final check the best i could find locally was 2100 with a warranty not counting labor shipping taxetc and a core charge the cts transmission was only 1600 now 500 might not be a huge amount to some people but thats more than i spent last year on maintainance on my 4x4    with that sort of potential repair and the issues that keep coming upplus the new toyota recall now i cant recommend toyota other than for their trucks,plekto
2675,February 2010,who buys a new transmission almost nobody it must be a regional thing the numbers i cited were local it must be a supply and demand issue in the la area which is a very narrow slice of information to make a broad generalization on    the other potential reason for the difference is that cts trannies may be crap you get what you pay for    i have no problems with toyota i would buy any of their cars in a heartbeat recalls or not doesnt bother me in the least i really like the toyota se and am mulling over buying it,kdshapiro
2676,February 2010, toyota just has problems recently and id not recommend anything with an automatic or etcelectronic throttle control on it from themthats 80 of their line currently     couldnt agree more throw in transmission hesitation i had a hesitating 2005 v6 toyota you could never pinpoint when it would happen but it did several times a day i reached the end of my rope when it had a full 2 second hesitation while highway passing when it kicked in i almost had whiplash the car took off so fast very dangerous it was dumped after 1 year as the tsb didnt work i was done after 21 years of loyalty and great vehicles the worst part being toyota refusing to acknowledge the problem to my knowledge it still exists finally the toyota brake issue toyota has some quality control issues going on right now,1bythesea
2677,February 2010,im confused why are the words toyota toyota and toyota even doing in a ellux performance sedan forum anyway the words luxury and performance dont even belong in the same discussion as toyota,smarty666
2678,February 2010,you have to read the threads there was an assertion an infinity pontiacx is cheaper to own than a toyota of course based on the metric one choses it could be shown to be cheaper    hope this clarifies your conford,kdshapiro
2679,February 2010,wow thats a weird question to ask the tires alone make the infiniti more expensive alone,smarty666
2680,February 2010,i guess the reason they are included is because i see toyota as toyota since its just one company in japan  with 40 or so different vehicles ranging from econoboxes for the poor to luxury cars and even military transport vehicles and commercial equipment also many of the lexus models share dna and parts with the more common vehicles which is where the problem is right now toyota isnt admitting it but of course lexus models are also going to be affected    that said manual transmission toyotalexus models are fine they have no computers in the way and are as solid as a tank the same can be said tor mercedes benz as well if you get a c or e class sedan with manualyes i know only automatics normally make it over here in the us they are extremely reliable cars stripped of all of the electronic junk and transmission and throttle and everything else that tries to outthink you they are perfectly fine vehicles    now the real question i guess is what out there that is a luxury car doesnt have all of that technological garbage applied to it im unfortunately having a hard time getting any names on my list as least for stuff that i can buy in the us,plekto
2681,February 2010,i know that the problems with all cars now a days everything is computerized in the car and the inside and outside of the car is loaded down with cheap plastics for almost everything,smarty666
2682,February 2010,as someone pointed out earlier when discussing maintenance costs we are not talking about oil change break pads sort of thing but repair cost should a car broke down  and how frequent that happens    in my 3 years of ownership of a 2007 bmw i had to take her in 3 times for unscheduled maintenance each and everyone it was due to malfunction of some kind of electronic control unit and the solution each time was to replace some module these are repairs that cannot be performed by mechanics no matter how good they are not to mention the expensive diagnosis equipment they would have to purchase other than these electronic issues i never had any problem what so ever however it is these electronic problems that keep me from owning another german car because they are notorious on electronic components i do not want to be in a position where i have no choice but to go to the dealer for repair after the warranty expires,jtla
2683,February 2010,you may see toyota as toyota but there is enough differences between a lexus vehicle and a toyota vehicle that is like saying i see nissan and infiniti as one company since the same engine and a lot of dna is shared between the two companies    your original point which is a silly statement is an infiniti is cheaper to own than a toyota i guess as silly as it sounds if you live in la its true in the rest of the world its a laughable thought,kdshapiro
2684,February 2010,no i said that an infiniti is cheaper to maintain than a lexus hondaing to actual research and i provided a link for the data as well,plekto
2685,February 2010,no you provided one link which i dont believe just because its on the internet doesnt mean its true or maybe its true by one measure and false by another edmunds tco tells a completely different story additionally i dispute your research for indicated tranny prices as my research indicates the exact opposite    anyone who buys an infiniti thinking its the cheapest thing around to maintain is foolish i could make the statement bmw for the first four years is the cheapest car to maintain in the world and i would be correct and factual does it tell the whole story no,kdshapiro
2686,February 2010,as someone pointed out earlier when discussing maintenance costs we are not talking about oil change break pads sort of thing but repair cost should a car broke down  and how frequent that happens    then we should be discussing repair costs not maintenance costs maintenance is maintenance as in the manufacturers suggested maintenance    not to mention one persons maintenance is usually not comparable to anothers for instance i may like to maintain my car by changing the oil every 4k with synthetic while someone else with the same car may prefer every 7k with offtheshelf oil    you dont find this sort of variance with repair costs as long as both go to a dealer that is  17 ford crew 27 67 coronet rt 14 towncountry limited 09 lsubaru hse 44car history and counting,qbrozen
2687,February 2010,no you provided one link which i dont believe just because its on the internet doesnt mean its true    id call intellichoice as reputable a source as edmunds or any of the other research sites if you look back 34 years lexus and toyota were at the top as you probably would expect but in the last few years toyota has had massive problems with its entire line of vehicles that theyve been fairly good at hiding and denying until very recently its not surprise that one of the other japanese makers has managed to move into the 1 position as a result    2009  httpwwwintellichoicecomtop10toplistyeasubaru009listlowest20repaisubaru0cos  ts    2006  httpwwwintellichoicecomtop10toplistyeasubaru006listlowest20repaisubaru0cos ts    its been a very hard three years for toyota,plekto
2688,February 2010,i find this discussion about maintenance costs very interesting since i have a infiniti acura and mb its hard for me to add anything really important or helpful to discussion since in the 6 years i have had each car i havent had anything but normal maintenance stuff done to each vehicle and no other problems as of yet in regards to normal maintenance the infiniti has been the most expensive to maintain because the gas mileage is lower than my acura or mb and plus it has a larger tank than the other two air and cabin filters were the cheapest in my acura to replace    overall i think my acura has been the cheapest to maintain but dont get me wrong both the infiniti and mb are not that much more expensive and ive been pretty happy at the amount each one has been to maintain,smarty666
2689,February 2010,pick your metric to prove your point tco for a generic infiniti pontiacx is much more than a generic toyota btw i call intellichoice a rag which is why i do not believe their metrics,kdshapiro
2690,February 2010,its an interesting discussion but what is being discussed has to be clear as gbrozen stated above maintenance is not repair you may be of the ilk who likes to change their oil once a month even if you put on 12k miles a year thus driving maintenance costs up    i am talking about repair which is after the warranty expires how much does it cost to get brakes replaced altenator transmission water pump ecu light assembly sunroof etc a lexus bmw acura infiniti audi will have a higher repair bill than a toyota and honda this assumes you go to the dealer for service    as long as nothing goes wrong with the car after the warranty expires oil changes are cheap the major services run into some money a friend paid 275 dollars for his 7500 mile service on his acura sure he could have gone to jiffy lube and saved a few bucks but he wanted the dealer experience    a bmw is the cheapest car to maintain because it costs you 0 for four years but what happens after four years,kdshapiro
2691,February 2010,as i pointed out in my post i would not be able to give any honda into repair work because i have not had anything yet fail or need to be replace so hopefully others can help you in that regard    best of luck,smarty666
2692,February 2010,275 for a 7500 mile service    i think that is a dealer experience that i could do without,billpaul
2693,February 2010,i recently talked to a toyota mechanic there are two dealerships side by side one is a lexus dealership and one is toyota he was mazdar with both cars i asked him if there were any similarities between them he said that when you get up under a lexus or a toyota you are looking at the same car,temj12
2694,February 2010,interesting post which of the vehicles is the best made i do not own a german car but i have always thought that mercedes benz was the best built structurally of any luxury car,temj12
2695,February 2010,interesting post which of the vehicles is the best made i do not own a german car but i have always thought that mercedes benz was the best built structurally of any luxury car    i doubt that mb are even in the top 5 of the any luxury car category although they would have you think so rolls royce bentley bugatti maybach are surely top of the heap and then there is a whole slew of builders who would tie for the next places mb would have the s class in there but not much else in the past 510 years here in uk they rate pretty poor in jd power surveys lexus always beats em  as do skoda and thats a volkswagen cheapobrand although it also beats volkswagen and audi every time    then of course maybach is to mb as lexus is to toyota,alltorque
2696,February 2010,its odd really mercedes benz make the best engines and bodies and car that i know of but the accessories and automatic transmissions are among the worst the only way to buy one then is manual everything and no options at all and with a manual transmission they sell these in europe but not in the usbarring gems like the c230k they made a few years ago    the best built for cars is actually a near tie between nissan mazda and honda honda gets the 3 placeby maybe a foot behind the others if only because their prices on parts have gone up in the last few years    for trucks and suvs nissan and toyota if you get one with a manual transmission that is,plekto
2697,February 2010,best built cars are porsche owners never take repair tools to rallyes    with the exception of the a toyota is more expensive to own than a infiniti debating who makes the more bulletproof car is like debating vanilla vs chocolate most cars will easily make it to 150000 miles i know a few bmw owners north of 200000 miles    its what happens after the warranty where it gets interesting,kdshapiro
2698,February 2010,only problem is porsche is by no means of the imagination a entrylevel luxury vehicle and the majority cant afford them,smarty666
2699,February 2010,absolutely correct some of the cars weve been discussing arent quite elps either but you can almost make the case if one can include a loaded 335 one can almost include a boxster,kdshapiro
2700,February 2010,best built cars are porsche owners never take repair tools to rallyes    thats because theres no room p,fedlawman
2701,June 2010,if you look at the tread of a typical at tire its nearly identical to most nondirectional allseason car tires as such its worthless in snow and mud and really should be considered the truck equivalent of a street  only tire now for a lot of people it works fine enough they see a tiny bit of dirt and some subaru roads every so often and for their softroader suvs life is good    but for snow you absolutely need mud terrain tires as a minimum and 4x4 engaged also look for a tread pattern that has lots of sipes in it the older bfg mud terrains were very bad in rain for this reasonzero sipes anywhere though good otherwise,plekto

2704,July 2010,thanks for the link to 2011 volvo volvo t6 awd i read it the first time you posted    the new volvo looks promising i think its t6 engine power output  300 horsepower and 325 poundfeet of torque  is among the top of this group especially the torque imo volvo did a fine job in both exterior styling and interior layout as to handling we will have to wait until the car hits the showroom and do a proper test drive    while this car may be a legitimate contender the biggest problem for volvo may be the lack of convincing reason for potential buyers to choose it over the competition for performance the 3series and infiniti still lead the pack for luxurious feels tl and audi may have the edge for dependability reputation the japanese brands are always safer bets for badge shoppers mb certainly sounds more prestigious safety is volvos strong suite but others are not far behind a volvo is just so easy to lost in this crowded segment and its new chinese ownership doesnt help either,jtla
2705,July 2010,jtla  yeah that past post is now gone as is the one above your post have to play by mr edmunds rules or else i agree with you the t6 pretty interesting with all the torque and have to agree its a tough sell in this market giving volvos past efforts in the space and the competitors but i do like the fact that they are doing something which intern will make the group better,sweendogy

2708,July 2010,i apologize if pissed anyone off that is certainly not my intent im definitely not trying to rock the boat but as you know qualitative researchers want to talk to people indepth about particular subjects in order to dive deep on a subject we need to restrict the number of people  its just a numbers thing we cant hear from everyone and get good quality information and analyze it if were hearing from hundreds and hundreds of people so we filter people based on basic demographic information i clearly stated in my invite to see if you qualify hyundai here im really sorry if it my qualifying survey rubbed you the wrong way its not my intent,dialogue_dean
2709,July 2010,before buying a nissan i was purchasing not leasing so that ruled out bmw mercedes benz and the audi out of my price range anyway lexus does nothing for me i wanted allwheel drive for the cadillac and infiniti so they were priced out of reach  i didnt much care for the buick came down to the tl and nissan i liked them pretty much equally the fact that the nissan could be had for about 2k less than the tl had more features and that i liked the interiorexterior styling better than the tl sold me  i think the nissan should be included here,kfdmed
2710,July 2010,sorry but as much as i like the nissan it does not belong to this discussion first and foremost nissan is not considered a luxury brand secondly nissan comes in fwd drivetrain with cvt transmission  not a performancesport sedan in my book,jtla
2711,July 2010,tl has a five speed the nissan with the cvt will perform as well if not better than most the cars listed on the right true it is not a luxury brand so i guess it doesnt belong,kfdmed
2712,July 2010,while the nissan cvt is about as good as it gets from a cvt type of transmission performance and cvt are mutually exclusive terms for many folks myself included,shipo
2713,July 2010,the lexus is is rwd you are correct on tl and acura being fwd but tl does offer shawd not on acura to enhance handling,jtla
2714,July 2010,what he said,kevinc5
2715,July 2010,how many tls are sold in awd form i would conclude the tl is more nissan then g or bmw  its fwd it has 280 hp it comes only in auto and only comes in 4 doors here is a link for those who are going to stay it comes in manualreally    httpwwwmotortrendcomfeaturesconsumesubaru00410carsyoudidntknowyoucoul dgetwithastickinsubaruhtml,sweendogy
2716,July 2010,well none of these cars are sports cars the question is how much sport do you want i dont think fwd is a huge disadvantage in this category  99 of people shopping this segment wont be able to tell the difference    the fwd tl may be less sporty than a rwd infiniti but it is definitely sportier than a nissan    i personally agree that the cvt completely eliminates any hope for the nissan being included in this category its seems more like a sportier toyota toyota to me,fedlawman
2717,July 2010,excellent topic to say the least considering i have a 3g fwd tl a fwd nissan the new one and a rwd infiniti i think i can add some decent honda on this i can tell you this the cvt does take a little away from making the nissan a true sports sedan like a infiniti or 3series but that is only bc of the noise during acceleration and lack of shift shock the nissan is just as sporty as the 4g fwd tl but fwd in itself does have limitations that rwd obviously and my 3g tl has a more sporty flair to it then the 7g nissan    the new nissan has virtually no torque steer during brisk acceleration and ive been able to keep up with higher powered v6s with both at and mt so the power and performance of the nissan is not hindered by the cvt in the least    saying the nissan is a sportier version of an toyota is a little bit ridiculous to me drive both cars back to back and they are totally different the nissan handling is much more crisp and precise then just about anything else in the fwd market except for say mazda maybe i would go as far as to say that the nissan is about as sporty as you can go in performance driving dynamics handling etc for a fwd sedan without having to spend more money and go into a rwd luxury division vehicle it is a four door sports sedan no the cvt and fwd layout prevent it becoming that but its a sporty four door sedan    except for one or two things the cvt is not as bad as people make it out to be it takes a few months but you get used to and then when you get back into a vehicle with a regular at and feel shift shock you think something is wrong    in regards to fitting into this thread category its tuff to say the nissan is an oddity and hard to classify its not from a luxury division and some people have difficulty using the word luxury and nissan in the same sentence and i can understand that on the other hand the powerperformance price luxury sedan features etc that you can get in this car would suggest and warrant at least a entrylevel luxury classification everyone will tell you something different bc there are no books stating what car classes there are and what goes into what    ive heard people classify the nissan has followed over the years entrylevel luxury sedan premium fullsize sedan near luxury sedan pick anyone you want and use it or whatever floats your boat it really in the grand scheme of things doesnt mean jack squat,smarty666
2718,July 2010,have any driven the nissan cvt for any period of time driven it in the sport mode the cvt in sport mode does more than just give you shift shock  the engine revs more like a traditional auto transmission i once thought whats the point of artificial shifting in a cvt after using it for a while i understand why they included with the cvt  i drove the base fwd tl and nissan back to back and dont think the tl is any more sporty than the nissan,kfdmed
2719,July 2010,the 4g fwd tl is less sporty in my opinion then the 7g fwd nissan not by much but enough i noticed a difference the nissan had a slightly firmersportier ride and feedback slightly better handling and the look of the actual vehicle was sportier your right the cvt in sport mode does help to give the shift shock imitation which is important in the feedback department louder exhaust note upon acceleration when gunning it compared to regular drive and the engine revs as you mentioned all of which provides the sportier needs anyone would want from a regular at    now once you move up to the awd 6 mt version of the 4g tl that the tl becomes sportier than the new nissan but the base version is definitely tamer then the new nissan    remember a lot of people have valid critisms and hatred of the cvt bc of what happened with the 1g version of it from 20032008 since 2009 all the nissan products have the updated 2g cvt which is much more efficient less troubles and far fewer problems then the 1g had nissan extended the transmission warranty so the cvt for them is here to stay so far i overall really like the cvt and the fuel econ for 290hp is absolutely fabulous,smarty666

2722,July 2010,not much to say in a while but always lurking    my 2004 v70 now has 110000 trouble free miles installed a set of bilsteins recently and its like a new car again    my bmw is going strong with 215000 miles and no significant services in almost 2 years no plans to replace either one any time soon  in this economy i like having no monthly car payment    how about you going to replace the x3 with something bigger to fit your growing family,fedlawman
2723,July 2010,standing pat just like you the prelude is still motoring along with over 123000 miles on the odometer i just had to replace the 2 front upper control arms the lf ball joint was really loose  it comes as an assembly with the control arm do you think i should have an alignment done    the acura is our family hauler for the forseeable future we just bought a house and dont want to take on any more monthly payments    truthfully id like to get a repalcement note i didnt say i want to replace for the prelude maybe next year if it is in the budget it doesnt have latches for the car seats  truthfully i dont feel if i have to take my kids somewhere that buckling the car seats in with the seat belt is anywhere nearly as strong as the latches    im probably going to want the next x3 but im sure the turbo version with only a few options is going to push 50k  the 240 hp na motor isnt going to cut it for my needs i live in ct now and to say the on dodgeps are short is an understatement plus there are stop signs before you merge onto the parkway not yield signs both my prelude and acura need a running start due to their lack of low end torque  2001 prelude type sh 2015 infiniti q40 awd 2017 honda honda touring awd,nyccarguy
2724,July 2010,yup get an alignment    no need for you to go down the new car every 3 years road its a trap 21000 for a low mileage x3 with known history sounds like a bargain to me,fedlawman
2725,July 2010,well it depends and i live in a rural city area so the mpg is going to be better then a big major city obviously so far the best mpg is in the spring marmay and fall octnov and that is 2627 mpg avg with 24mpg city and 3034mpg highwayinterstate    now in the summer with the ac on and the high humiditytemps each of those figures ive given you have gone down about 2mpg ive been avg since the middle of june about 2324 mpg avgs with 22mpg city and 2831mpg on highway,smarty666
2726,July 2010,no need for you to go down the new car every 3 years road its a trap    exactly ive had my club sport for 15 years the wrangler for 8 years and the x3 for five with no plans to replace them anytime soonnever in the case of the club sport my 1975 2002a is going to be my sons first car he eventually wants a 944924s so i told him to drive the 02 for a year if he keeps his grades up and doesnt collect any accidents or tickets well sell the 02 and he can get a p car although hell have to pay the difference between the selling price of the 02 and the purchase price of the porsche  mine 1995 318ti club sport  2014 m235i  1999 wrangler  1996 speed triple challenge cup replica wifes 2016 i3 rex2009 cooper clubman sons 2009 bmw,roadburner

2729,July 2010,youre right about the 21k for a used x3 with a known history is a good deal i just dont have the money right now in fact if i would have known how willing the bmw dealer was going to sell off the contracted residual maybe i would have kept on driving the x3  then it would have like 60k miles on it and be worth even less  2001 prelude type sh 2015 infiniti q40 awd 2017 honda honda touring awd,nyccarguy
2730,July 2010,when i am asked questions i dont want to answer and am not compelled to answer i just say na on the other hand i usually have no privacy issues  since there is none anymore  and i am not really off put by such questions    i mean i think i would rather look at survey results about steak vs lamb vs chicken from people who were meat eaters rather than folks who for whatever reason chose not to eat meat    i guess income is a data point  folks who make 6 figures may not buy bmw but perhaps folks who make low 5 figures can not buy them i for one would be interested in someones opinion who actually participated in buying owning and driving x rather than someone who for wahtever reason did not buy own or drive x    i dont participate in bently forums and now with the price of the new audi for instance i wont participate there either i cant afford a bently and at 95000 for a new audi the sacrifices in other parts of my life make it as a practical matter unaffordable too    i say market away  just dont make me hyundai up information confuse,markcincinnati
2731,August 2010,listen im kinda of in the middle of this bc i have a tl 3g a infiniti and the new nissan having vehicles from all three makes each automaker has pros and cons compared to the other one one isnt ddodgeatically better then the other they each do certain things better than the other so its just a matter of what things your really want or are willing to sacrifice    im just trying to keep the peace i guess,smarty666
2732,August 2010,but the g is rwdawd vs fwd nissan and has a 7speed vs cvt  given the choice i would take a tl shawd first a infinitix second nissan third and a base tl fourth if money was no object i have a limited budget so the nissan worked for me best i liked the interior size of the tl except for the trunk size over the infinitix the g is a bit cdodgeped inside  the nissan has the best overall style inside and out and is just the right size  and it has the superior glove box  its huge,kfdmed
2733,August 2010,smarty i am with you on this keep your cool billy    i owned both nissan and honda in the past and bought a 2010 infinitis in march  would have chosen tl shawd had it been the same size as the 3g tl personally i like the intimate feel in a cabin some may think the interior of infiniti is cdodgeped but coming from a 2007 bmw bmw it feels spacious to me    a friend of mine is considering the bmw 5series but i strongly recommend the tl to him and save the 10k15k i think i almost sounded like a acura salesperson    there isnt any bad car in this class just personal preference,jtla

2738,August 2010,billy like you i have owned my g from the moment i drove it off straight cash homey randy moss but unlike you i did research when buying the car i got one that was less money more powerful and better looking a better car fact i understand your love for your car but noone else except 35k people sales number down from 75k from 06 one in 6k comes in stick in the states have bought that car they did a bad job in the redoing it fact for you to post comments about the nissanquestnissan is just nonsense  in your tl chat i posted not only the differences in the engine but also the fact the nissan line ex z and gtr are fwd  fact please post one fact just one    and enjoy your upgrades i hope you install the lights under the car those are always nice    smarty  you always seem to find me  your always there to save a tl 20092010 owner when they are in a pickle nice work but you made the right choice in 2008 when they were making fwd normal sedans that had an edgenot performance sedans,sweendogy
2739,August 2010,im not billy  you replied to the wrong post,tlong
2740,August 2010,through the years ive owned a toyota supra an acura tl acura cl an acura acura and a 2004 infiniti pontiac5 and my wife has a 2007 pontiac5 owned several honda and a prelude all nice cars    however the transmissions went out after the warranty on the tl and the acura we had a great deal of problems with the cl the transmission went out on my brothers acura and his honda all of these transmission blow ups occurred shortly after the extended warranty ended    older honda were bulletproof and unbelievably reliable transmission problems there now too    the infinitis are fun to drive reliable great looking and reasonably priced mpg suffer a bit but its not bad their awd is amazing and the car is 100 rear wheel drive unless it detects a need to use the front wheels    when the new body style on the infiniti sedan comes out in a year or two i will be one of the first in line to test drive it,2233
2741,August 2010,i forgot to mention another important point    infinitis and nissan have timing chains honda and acuras have timing belts    timing belts are 600800 to replace and if they break it probably will cost you a new engine    timing chains are virtually indestructible,2233
2742,August 2010,not all hondaacuras have timing belts for example the acura and 4 cylinder acura use a timing chain    even though the timing chains are generally lifetime items one should replace tensioners and guides every 100000 miles the infiniti uses 3 timing chains and replacing the tensioners and guides involves removing the exhaust starter ac compressor and upper oil pan  about 11 book hours    how much do you think your dealer will charge for that,fedlawman
2743,August 2010,i wasnt aware that the 4 cyl acura and the acura use a timing chain    ive never heard of a timing chain breaking or needing replacing it may be expensive if it did happen but it rarely happens    timing belts are a maintenance item and are expensive to replace if the timing belt breaks while you are operating the vehicle a new engine will generally be required ive heard of many timing belts breaking which cause at minimum a bent valve a hole in your piston or a need for a total engine overhaul    if you are lucky and your acura timing belt does not break you can use the money you save to buy a new transmission check the acura posts if you dont believe me,2233
2744,August 2010,until acura gets the transmission issues of the acura rl and tl resolved i would never consider an acura    many tls are on their 3rd transmission hondaing to this edmunds site,duke39
2745,August 2010,ive never heard of a timing chain breaking or needing replacing it may be expensive if it did happen but it rarely happens    replace your timing belt every 6 years or 100000 miles whichever comes first and it will be as reliable as a chain    timing belts are a maintenance item and are expensive to replace    a basic timing belt service will run 300 at an independent mechanic youll only pay 600 if you include a new tensioner idler pulley serpentine belt and water pump    have you priced new tensioners guides serpentine belt and water pump for the infiniti,fedlawman
2746,August 2010,the acuras with timing belts are interference types which means you will likely need a new engine if your belt breaks not so with chains    have you priced new engines for an acura    how about new transmissions for an acura    ,2233
2747,August 2010,gravity pulls objects down so if lightning strikes the tree next to your driveway and the tree falls on your infiniti youll likely need a new car,fedlawman
2748,August 2010,the majorwidespread transmission issues with acura vehicles ended in either 2005 or the 2004 model year people with 2006 model years are not running into transmission issues like you guys are trying to imply go and check crs reliability history charts for all the acura models and youll see that starting with the 2006 model years the transmissions got above avg or much above avg ratings if you look at the charts the black dots for transmission issues were for 2004 model year and earlier i have had two tls so far one which had a lot of miles on it and had absolutely no issues    get your facts straight before you go bad mouthing an entire brand to anyone else if you get an acura model 2006 youll have little to no worry about transmission issues very very reliable vehicles,smarty666
2749,August 2010,i guess you neglected to check the acura transmission problem section on edmunds    there are many posts about transmission and clutch problems in 2006 vehicles not just 2005 and prior models    remember it took several years before the transmission problems surfaced regarding the transmission failures of tls from 19992005 now the problems with the 2006 transmissions are surfacing next year we may hear about problems from 2007    acuras customer service and care are terrible at the national level also,2233
2750,August 2010,trust me acura customer service is ten times better than anything ive gotten from both infiniti or nissan when ive had a issue question or warranty problem that needed to be addressed acura at least pretends like they care even if in the end they cant help you out nissaninfiniti on the other hand just flat out wont believe you and tells you anything wrong with your vehicle is normal the customer service treatment i received from gm for almost 30 years was an abomination to say the least acura might not be as high as caddy jaguar or lexus for customer service but trust me there are much worse customer service from other companies out there    just remember the population sample of edmunds reports is a small minority of the total owners who have acura vehicles and we dont here from the vast majority of acura owners on edmunds only a small group sometimes only a few hundred out of the hundreds of thousands of acura owners doesnt mean there isnt a problem but you have to take the sample size of problems with a grain of salt and try not to paint a broad brush as your trying to do that all acuras are bad products    you can make this same point with any automakers and their specific problems you here complained and reported here on edmunds and then paint a broad brush about the entire automaker and try to frighten people not to get those brands    gm numerous power steering and airbag issues in various models  honda brakerotor issues on several models  toyotalexus acceleration transmission and safety issues  nissan early gen cvt issues  bmw numerous electricalsensor issues that need to be fixed  chrysler various mechanicalsafety issues across the board  infiniti huntingpecking and communication issues with transmissioncomputer  audi some mechanicalelectrical gremlins in a more than avg chunk of its models    the list can go on and on for each automaker and the point is you take your chances with anyone of them it just depends on what one gives you a slightly higher chance of not getting a problem model from that automaker    i can tell you with having two acuras both 2006 that i have had no problems or no sign of problems with my transmission and i dont know anyone personally with a honda or acura model that has or has had transmission issues i belong to a few acura boards and the majority do not have transmission issues i only have seen a few dozen over the years on those boards report transmission issues not that they cant happen but they are not happening left and right with every acura model and in the intensity your trying to portray it as,smarty666
2751,August 2010,acuras customer service and care are terrible at the national level also     i went to test drive a tltype s in january 2007 in fdodgeingham ma the roads were clear and dry during a spell of unusually warm weather in the 70s    the torque steer was surprisingly difficult to handle to the point where i dismissed the car as an undisciplined and poorly designed automobile nicely appointed but dangerous to drive aggressively    what really turned me off though was the attitude of the salesman who took me for the drive upon returning to the showroom i wanted to know more about the vehicle and asked for the detailed brochure as i like to devour the technical details and be able to imagine myself behind the wheel the salesman told me they didnt have any brochures that i wasnt ready to buy and to come back when i was ready he was arrogant and rude he then promptly walked away leaving me thoroughly unattended    that turned me off acuras so completely that i wouldnt even consider another dealership too bad as this one was less than 1 mile from my home    i then went to a local bmw dealership that i had avoided as i didnt think i could afford a bmw i did a test drive of the 335xi i was so impressed by the car but more importantly the manner of the salesman and the time he took to chat with me over the next 7 months when i would drop by that we are now on our 3rd bmw from the same dealership 07 335xi traded for an 11 bmw bmw and my wifes 08 328xi    acura no thanks,xeye
2752,August 2010,get your facts straight before you go bad mouthing an entire brand to anyone else if you get an acura model 2006 youll have little to no worry about transmission issues very very reliable vehicles    i just turned 100k miles on my 05 tl and the only repair other than routine stuff was a recall for a temperature sensor no other problems,tlong
2753,August 2010,trust me ive had much better customer service with infiniti i guess it comes down to the individual dealership so this can vary from city to city    all i know is that we had 3 acuras and all 3 had the transmissions go out thats my experience    around 2003 my brother and i went shopping for an acura for him we asked about the reported transmission problems in the tls from 2000 and 2001 the salesman was adamant that the problem only existed in the early 1999 and 2000 transmission in the tl he indicated that there were no problems in the later tls and never in the acura    guess what my brothers acuras transmission went out last year now we see 2006 transmission problems with the tl    keep us posted in a couple of years on your tl or an acura if you own one it takes 4 years for this problem to manifest itself and become public i am in contact with the nhtsa re any deaths or injuries from the tl trans failures    hopefully you will be lucky    my family is batting 1000 with 3 for 3 transmission failures,2233
2754,August 2010,interesting how how you and i have had the complete opposite experience with customer service when it has come to infiniti and acura respectively    the world is a strange place,smarty666
2755,August 2010,is that transmission a manual or auto    i thought all the tranny failures for hondaacura were related to the auto    pre 2006 i knew of 4 people with an honda honda and they all had the trannies replaced a close friend was on his 3rd they were all replaced with rebuilt versionsthey presumably still had the design defect    i assumed that the new versions were redesigned and good nowwho knows maybe their failure rate was the same as others and the owners are just more vocal    i maybe wrong in my assumptionsbut id be pretty pod if any transmission went outat anytime throughout the life of the vehicle of course with the caveat that youre not at the drag strip or towing 10k lbs everyday,ivan_99
2756,August 2010,our 3 transmissions that failed were automatic i dont know about the 2006s though    i agree with the poster who said that all brands have their problems quirks and nuances how the manufacturer resolves these problems is what is crucial    i complained for 5 years about the transmission in my tl acura only performed a jet kit quick service of some sort thats it complained constantly about the other 2 also that went out acura refused to replace these unless they went out during the warranty period    my daughter drove the tl and constantly called me worrying that she would not make it to her destination and would break down on an chevroletway this eventually happened    acura could have replaced this transmission with a rebuilt one and that would have satisfied me but they chose not to do so    an acura rep in california named ingrid took 11 days to tell me they would pay for 10 of the repair after the tl trans went out that was insulting and waiting 11 days was inconsiderate at best    my 2004 infiniti pontiac5 had a well known problem with the brake pads wearing out prematurely however they were proactive after i had 35000 miles on the vehicle they contacted me and put 4 new pads and new front rotors on the car at their expense they even gave me a free loaner and an oil change    at 68000 miles i took the pontiac5 into infiniti of ann arbor and reported that rear rotors may need turning i mentioned the pads and rear rotor replacement from 3 years earlier they called infiniti and gave me 4 new pads turned the front rotors and replaced the rears at no cost incredible    last month we took my wifes 2007 pontiac5 to this dealership with 40k miles on it for a front rotor turning the service advisor said they just received a tsb indicating that a problem with the front suzuki guards may have caused warping of the front rotors they replaced the front suzuki guards and turned the front rotors at no cost    this is truly great service this is what we experienced with infiniti    disregarding constant complaints and arrogance is what we got from acura in addition to 3 blown transmission between my brother and us    none of us ever towed a thing nor did we abuse the acuras in any way    acura is not proactive and infinti was for us    acura should learn from the lessons re the toyota and lexus models they ignored and covered up the problem and look how it affected them    by the way i purchased a new nissan nissan for my daughter on friday,2233

2758,August 2010,when i got my new nissan last year the auto up features on the front windows did not work at all after two visits to the nissan stealers and being told they worked fine and that it was my fault they wouldnt go up in the way i was pushing the button i called nissan consumer affairs i reported the problem to them and without even asking me any details they too tried to blame me and say i was not pushing the button correctly they then went behind my back called the stealer where i took the car and then called me back saying they talked to the stealer and they couldnt find anything wrong    about a week went by and i did some of my own research online and found a tsb put out by nissan for the autoup feature not working on the nissan and what needed to be done to correct it printed out the tsb and took it into the stealer on the third trip gave them the paper and threatened to get the stealership owner involved if they did not address the issue    suffice it to say third time was the charm on such a ridiculously noncomplicated issue that both the nissan stealer and nissan consumer affairs could have addressed but do to their idiotic and poor customer service i was dismissed and blamed for my warranty problem    doesnt get any worse then that never have had acura stealer blame me for a warranty or issue on my vehicles yet    ive got 2 or 3 more issues i could describe but this specific one above is enough to illustrate my point shades,smarty666
2759,August 2010,you know why you didnt have any troubles with infiniti in regards to your brake and rotor issues bc i went through the same thing with them on my 2005 infiniti every 10k miles i had to have my brakes replaced and rotors resurfaced bc how poorly they were madegrinded together when ever i applied the brakes i had this terrible grindingshimmy through the pedals and wheels which always indicated to me i was nearing the 10k mile mark for another infiniti stealer visit    luckily it was all covered under warranty which i never could understand bc most automakers consider brakerotor wear a normal wear and tear item which is not covered under warranty come to find out there were multiple class action lawsuits against infiniti for poor brakerotor problems that people with early year pontiac5 and infiniti45 vehicles had infiniti was not covering the brakes and rotor repairs even for people that had their brakes and rotors shot to hell after only 67k miles on them enough people sued and infiniti was forced to settle and cover the brake and rotor repairs under warranty it wasnt until infiniti was forced to do the right thing that they actually stepped up and did it    thats the reason why all those issues you had were covered under warranty at no cost to you enough people had problems and sued to get that stuff covered shame is infiniti continued to put poor quality brakerotors on their vehicles all the way up to 2008 models ive only recently seen signs that the issues on their models have changed with a changed to better quality brakerotors on their 2009 models and the frequency and occurrence of brakerotor issues has dropped ddodgeatically since the change in parts in 2009,smarty666
2760,August 2010,i had the same problem at north hampton acura the manager was under the impression i was selling my acura type s and untill i sold it i was no where he said to me i wasnt ready to deal he was a turkey from ma arrogant  i had 3300000 in my checking account my wife was looking to buy a acura what a nut case he got upset because i liked a acura and wanted to try it outit was a 2006 used he thought i was poor and needed a loanhe asked me if i was upside down on a loan  i got peeved and went 8 miles down route 1 and bought my wife a new lexusi did have to pay 5  sales tax in me and i think 120000 in excise tax also  prime motors of maine owns the place i guess they sold out in ma and bought half of the auto mile in saco me id stay away from them lemon,puffin1
2761,September 2010,uhread consumer reports acura  all red meaning highly recommended that goes for over 75 of the acura fleet and highest resale value and bmw  audi  black or clear circle meaning they still have problems dah,gbosil
2762,September 2010,easy big fella ive been a subscriber to cr since the 1970s  as i write this im looking at the april 2010 annual auto issue for the 3series bmw crs newcar prediction is better than average which happens the be the same rating that cr gives to the acura tl  which also happens to beat the average rating that the toyota toyota v6 gets    the 5series bmw rating is only average but thats mainly because of problems that owners have had with its sound system the critical major systems  engine transmission fuel system electrical system etc  get mostly much better than average with a few getting better than average and lets face it a bum car stereo is annoying but it wont leave you stranded 500 miles from home,jimbres
2763,September 2010,many folks myself included consider consumer reports data highlyhighly suspect so much so that when they declared the 2002 530i the best car weve ever tested i nearly cancelled the order i placed on a 2002 530i sp 5speed the week before they made said declaration,shipo
2764,September 2010,not just that but there seems to be problem with the wheel alignment on the new 5series there is a discussion on edmunds talking about it and ive seen it mentioned on two other sites as well hope bmw gets a fix quick for it bc so far no luck hondaing to the new owners,smarty666
2765,September 2010,like it or dont believe it or not manymany of us have owned and driven bmw for many tens and even hundreds of thousands of miles with nor or very minimal issues    dont spoil their fun they need those urban legends to justify their sour grapes attitude  mine 1995 318ti club sport  2014 m235i  1999 wrangler  1996 speed triple challenge cup replica wifes 2016 i3 rex2009 cooper clubman sons 2009 bmw,roadburner
2766,September 2010,thats why i avoid buying the 1st year of a new model even so im confident that bmw will come up with a fix,jimbres
2767,September 2010,as i understand it the issue isnt the alignment of the new 5series perse it is a software issue im curious to find out what has changed between the prototype models and the production models that would cause such an issue,shipo
2768,September 2010,well the software glitch is causing an alignment issue since owners are reporting the cars are pulling to the right as i understand it they say bmw has issued a fix for the software problem but many drivers who had it applied are still getting the pull confuse,smarty666
2769,September 2010,not to worry theyll get it right,shipo
2770,September 2010,infiniti just announced pricing for the infiniti 31xxx 7 speed automatic only no sport suspension so what will this infiniti top out at 34k im out    an almost fully loaded infinitis w six speed stick stickers for 39xxx  sells for what 3536k    ill take 108 extra horsepower for 2000 please alex  2001 prelude type sh 2015 infiniti q40 awd 2017 honda honda touring awd,nyccarguy
2771,September 2010,infiniti knows that as well so i would assume there will be incentives on the infiniti bringing a fully loaded one to be less than a infiniti once incentives are applied to that vehicle i dont think infiniti is stupid enough to charge full msrp on a infiniti when a infiniti with incentives costs just about the same    i think the range of prices is 3034 thousand it will be interesting to see how many loaded ones will be on the lots compared to midlevel trims,smarty666
2772,September 2010,interesting post a lot of strong conclusions claiming fact without any data even opinion surveys    i bought a 3 series recently after owning an audi and a couple of saab 900s i bought these previous cars after testing tls and pontiac5s i certainly thought the japanese cars were as good looking and i liked the idea of owning a less blingy more reliable car but i like the road feel of the european cars so i bought the euromobiles even though they did not have as many standard toys i never tested a bimmer in these 3 shopping trips because i think there has been a stigma or stereotype of a haughty jerk that is connected with bimmer drivers so for me at least the bmw image was a turnoff    but i have a hearing loss and now need a quieter car so i tested more cars this time including the audi tl cc is es and the c300 and the 3 series even though i think the 328 sedan is the least attractive of all these cars especially the gorgeous c and g not only was the 3 series quieter than all but the land yacht es it handled better than the c300 and the audi it handled much better than the tl es and is the infiniti had similar handling and the 328 had better ergonomics for a 63 guy and better highway gas mileageemissions than all the other cars    as another poster mentioned the 328325 has better consumer reports repair ratings than audi and c300 and the same ratings as the japanese cars except for the land yacht i bought a three year used bmw for about 50 off original msrp i got over the image the bad one that is,edwardsf
2773,September 2010,again no body looks at all the post and picks and choose what they want to nit pick on it is a fact german automobiles cost more than their japanese counter parts with the same equipment etc im not saying nor did i say that was a bad thing its just the way it is    all i ever mentioned was the word prestige and how that contributes a lot to german luxury sales i did say that was not the sole and only reason that people buy german vehicles but many on here seem to have missed that i even mentioned bmw performancehandling as a key factor in conjunction with the bmw badge as reasons why they are so successful    you as well have strong conclusions claiming facts about the 3series without any data dont get me wrong the 3series is a great car but it doesnt have better city or highway gas mileage then all those other vehicles you test drove and i find it hard to believe it has the best ergonomics for a tall person considering there are other vehicles in that class with more front headroom then the 328 where when your taller headroom makes the most difference not saying the 3series is a bad car it certainly has several pros over some of the other entrylevel lux sedans but not in those areas you mentioned    bmw 1928 mpg fr headroom 385375  infiniti 1927mpg fr headroom 391372  audi 2230mpg fr headroom 400375  c300 1826mpg fr headroom 371369  tl 1826mpg fr headroom 384367  lexus 2130mpg fr headroom 372367  lexus 1927mpg fr headroom 378370    im not saying i only get japanese luxury vehicles because that couldnt be further from the truth ive had acura infiniti mercedes benz and a caddy so far unless acura changes direction ill most likely be shopping infiniti lexus bmw and audi the next time around,smarty666
2774,September 2010,every thing you just described here also related to buying an acura over a honda or hyundai or nissan    find that you like your acura  but wow talk about the kettle calling the pot black,murphydog
2775,September 2010,edwards i agree about the facts statement poor job in this and other tl related chats getting real facts for a laugh read the 2009  tl chat room its full of how fast the tl is verse other cars how it handles and other fluff pieces im banned from that chat  fact the 3 series no matter what the stigma or price is still the standard in the entry level lux group i think its a fantastic car myself and would of bot one but decided the extra 1015k i have a pontiac5x wasnt worth it vs 335xi for my needs i think all cars in this group are good choices but for performance its 3 series 335 then g from there you go down the line in no particular order and its prob lexus 328 tlawd c350 and catty 36 and further down the line is no order again audi cc sabb lexus lexus tl fwd acura infiniti caddy 28 suzuki,sweendogy
2776,September 2010,while that is true nissan hyundai honda etc are not luxury companies so its puzzling why they would be brought up here any luxury company in this country is going to have more prestige or what ever you want to call it from the mainstream parent company    i like the acura i have but nothing really from their current product line that is not new news and not the first time ive mentioned it on here,smarty666
2777,September 2010,easy now the main message you have been communicating in many of your posts is the following prestige and how that contributes a lot to german luxury sales and over and over but you cite no data to support that oft repeated claim that is my point not the other strawmen you bring up    and what exactly is a strong conclusion i made some statements such as the ergonomics are better for a 63 guy than the other cars um okay i got in the cars and moved the seats around i fit in the bmw much better than any of the cars including the audi which i actually owned so the manufacturers specs are relatively meaningless for all its warts cr does try to deal with the manufacturer discrepancies by trying to compensate for them but even cr does not account for sloping roof tops which hinder vision i take it you dont have that issue of being a big guy     which brings us to big highway mpg thanks for all your googling of stats but i dont think they help this connissantion the point of which is to share experiences and go beyond the manufacturer and epa dynometer specs if you look on fuelconomygov or at edmunds self reporting responses bmw get remarkable highway mileage  and mind you these are bmw drivers who drive fast the 328 528 and even 535335s are almost legendary for getting 2933 mpg going 70 mph i averaged 29 mpg going from sb to sf doing about 72 mph sure these are self reporting and anecdotal but the number of them certainly helped convinced me and my experience confirmed them again that is what these forums are for    also your mpg numbers use 2 pretty suspect models the audi fwd which is nonpermissible content removed due to the fuel saving cvt and the slow remarkably cdodgeped toyotalike lexus    btw my post starts off referencing your apparent mission bmw are for prestige hungry wannabees but mainly i just wanted some buyers to take a look at my personal experiences have a glass of wine or something after you drive that nose heavy tl that is,edwardsf
2778,September 2010,yes performance wise the g and the 3 series seemed much better to me than the rest i did not test the higher end 335 lexus c350 or tlawd as they seemed a bit pricey to me and the gas mileage on all except the 335 was pretty bad i dont need awd    so we all have our own needs which puts us into different markets i had never thought about it before but the tl drivers do seem to be a bit combative i think this thread has a huge tl vs g battle in past years i actually like both cars i considered both in 2 car purchases and think that many people would be happy with either i think the g and 3 series are a little more engaging to drive but every once in a while i pine for a slightly smoother car  maybe like a tl or c300 i never pine for a gm suzuki or toyota,edwardsf
2779,September 2010,smarty you just got worked lets hope billy posts something quick to cover this page up,sweendogy
2780,September 2010,i find it laughable that when i do post actual facts and stats that do not support inaccurate claims of the 3series superiority in certain areas like mpg for instance excuses are used as to why those competitor models get either better or the same fuel mpg then the 3series or puts them down regardless the 3series is not the best fuel economy vehicle in its class and just about matches the competition at best though the 3series is most likely the best in the category for acceleration handling and performance oriented capabilities each vehicle has advantages and disadvantages to its competitors it just depends on what fits your needs and wants the best    what disappointing now is that i have provided stats which are simply brushed off as not being able to go by what the manufacturers of their own vehicles put out so whats the point of providing stats if they are just going to be dismissed it seems hypocritical and a waste of my time then    anyone today can beat window sticker epa estimates in real world experiences and ive done it on my last 5 vehicles so that means that under ideal driving conditions and location any of those entrylevel lux vehicles can be exceeded in those numbers on real world conditions or lowered if conditions are not ideal    apparently by saying that a lot of bmw and mb sales are due to the prestige factor has offended some or they would not be making a big deal of it i have said before there is nothing wrong with that and im not trying to put them down based on it bmw mb and lexus would not be where they are if it was not for a long proud prestigious history in this country and they have rightly earned that reputation maybe it all has to do with the word a lot  maybe it would have been better to say some i dont know    apparently im some acura fan boy who hates all german vehicles he must of miss the part when i said ive had a mb before and im planning on shopping german the next time around i must be shopping on the prestige factor as well then p,smarty666
2781,September 2010,i am starting to like you  almost forgot tons of compliments just keep raining in on my white diamond pearl tl awd this gentleman at church told me to take good care of his car meaning my car  as another poster would say    happy motoring,billyperks2
2782,September 2010,i asked you for data to support your long series of posts adamently claiming that a big reason people buy german cars is for prestige you then supplied the data for headroom huh then i refute your data by stating that manufacturer space spec discrepancies are well known and you sound like i took your candy away    please try reading the actual posts and responding to the actual text of the posts it make the thread go better for instance if i say the 328 has better highway mpg than the other cars in its class you are not responding to that statement by saying the 3series is not the best fuel economy vehicle in its class that is what is called a strawman since you do it repeatedly i doubt i can convince you to stop but i will try anyway i did not refer to overall fuel economy as city mpg was not important to me in my purchase i like a lot of other people drive very little city miles as i walk or ride my bike to work    if i say that the cars you selectively posted are not a good representation of the 328 competitors you are not responding to my post by saying those competitor models get either better or the same fuel mpg then the 3series or puts them down regardless first i dont know what the heck that sentence means and second my statement stands unrefuted but if you want putdowns here is one for you the lexus is blingy scion tc please dont compare it to the 3 series    also i agree that no one cares about ones anecdotal experiences in beating the epa numbers however people do seem to care about the dozens of reports from owners that could amount to some cumulative evidence about the real world operation of the vehicle that they are considering the epa numbers are helpful for emissions though    i do agree with one line in your post apparently im some acura fan boy who hates all german vehicles,edwardsf

2785,September 2010,my real issue with the 3 series is that its now a seriously overweight and misguided vehicle when you compare it to its roots it just is a very fancy and plush sedan now it might be among the best in its class but thats a lot like the class that includes cars like a toyota and honda being the best of bland isnt what i want and neither is overweight and boring euro sedan    if you want a real sport sedan experience you need three componentsmanual is a given  1  rwd  2  inline engine preferably an i6 or turbo 4 180200hp minimum  3  curb weight under 3000lbs preferably 2800    nothing on the market fits this though a few coupes and roadsters do but just under 3600lbs is entirely in the wrong universe,plekto
2786,September 2010,the problem is that in this era of airbags anticrush passenger zones and gizmo packed cars i seriously doubt any company could build your real sport sedan for an affordable price    fwiw 1 the 2011 bmw weighs in at 3362 pounds only 165 pounds more than my 1999 bmw not too shabby    fwiw 2 the last time a 3series sedan with an i6 engine weighed 3000 or less was 1991 although the 1992 tipped the scales at 3021 lbs    fwiw 3 given that the much more capable 2011 bmw weighs only 341 pounds more than the 1992 325i i think bmw did a pretty good job at packaging all of the new safety requirements structural integrity and extra size personally if i was given the option of the 1992 or the 2011 id choose the 2011 every time although i would almost immediately chuck the rfts in favor of a good set of gfts a move that will knock another 25 pounds of weight off the car    best regards  shipo,shipo

2788,September 2010,145   almost immediately chuck the rfts in favor of a good set of gfts a move that will knock another 25 pounds of weight off the casubaru46    have you driven a 2011  not having driven a 335 since i bought what i have now i was rather impressed with the ride in 2 bmw  coupes  that i have recently driven 150 both with 19148 runflats i have read that the dampers were changed the ride was quite acceptable 150 and noticeably better than i recall from driving 2009s   ray  just one data point     2016 bmw 340i,rayainsw
2789,September 2010,the point is that no matter how much better the suspension gets at dealing with the extra unsprung weight of the rfts the ride and handling of the car will significantly improve by putting substanitally lighter gfts on the car and to a lesser degree the acceleration and braking will improve as well,shipo
2790,September 2010,agreed  does the 3 have a well in the trunk for  a full sized spare  2016 bmw 340i,rayainsw
2791,October 2010,shipos point is that with the right tires  dedicated winter tires  one can safely drive an rwd car on snowcovered roads did you switch to dedicated winter tires or were you using allseason tires when you tried to drive in rwd mode in snowy conditions    if the latter then you really werent addressing shipos point,jimbres

2793,October 2010,i didnt realize he was referring to winter tires so that is my bad if that is what he was making then maybe with really excellent quality winter tires you could get away with just rwd    you are right i had all season tires on the vehicle since i dont have the extra money lying around to go buy a second set of tires just for winter driving i cant see spending several hundred dollars for tires you only would use on occasion 23 months out of the year just my personal preference,smarty666
2794,October 2010,the acura does not offer a manual and you dont see its sales tanking    the acura is available with a 6speed mt  one of the best on the market,fedlawman
2795,October 2010,i cant see spending several hundred dollars for tires you only would use on occasion 23 months out of the year    spending several thousand dollars on awd that you only use on occasion and hurts performance the other 910 months is a much better idea confuse,fedlawman
2796,October 2010,acura does come in manualand has since they started making the carand has pretty sweet throws on acura sales not tanking i would like to see the numbers    the reason infinti offers a manual is to compete with the bmw 3 but i guess research shows that the lower 328 sells most cars as autos which for me is a shame i need a infinitix 6 speed    and on the diamler partnership i agree i hope they keep the nissan 37 or do they go to 40  it might be loud and offers less mpgs but its a pure beast,sweendogy
2797,October 2010,you cant afford a set of winter tires but you can afford to buy awd uhhh what did i miss    fwiw the winter tires paid for themselves and then some consider the following   i had the 530i for three winters before i turned it in at lease end   the winter wheeltire set cost me 1005   at lease end my factory tires all had at least 1mm more tread depth than bmw finances minimum and as such i didnt need to buy a new set of summer performance tires cost then 900 installed   after the bmw was gone i sold the winter wheeltire set for 500    long story short not only did i not pay a fifteen hundred to twentyfive hundred dollar up charge for awd i made 395 by spending the 1005 on the winter wheeltire set kinda like found money,shipo
2798,October 2010,hmm what is this agree thingy well okay i will run with it    regarding ground clearance i have the same issue with getting in and out my audi avec sport package was lower to the ground than my 3 series sans sport package and the audis seats were just a smidgen lower this meant i used my back much more getting out of the audi than i do now with the bimmer so make sure you try them all in various packages    btw the bimmer non sport seemed to be similar in cornering to the audi sport of course the audi sticks better due to awd but the bimmers steering is just sublime i truly think the audi is the balance between the bimmer and the mercedes benz    i also felt that the infiinty drove heavier than all three german cars the g almost reminded me of an american muscle car nb i only drove used 20078 models but since cars dont seem to get lighter i think the germans are probably more nimble feeling than the infinity    regarding my other infirmity i have a hearing loss and carefully scrutinized for road noise the germans win again especially the c300 and the 3 series the new audi was definitely my favorite car but it really was had much more road noise than the the others also the lexus were pretty quiet    that said i like almost all these cars on the list on the right the only exceptions are the caddy which just seems gauche and the cdodgeped slow lexus they all have their strengths and cars are really just better now,edwardsf

2800,October 2010,i cant see spending several hundred dollars for tires you only would use on occasion 23 months out of the year just my personal preference    my guess is that youre a young guy allseason radial tires didnt become widely available until the mid to late 1970s before that just about everyone who lived in the snow belt switched tires  from regular to snows as they were called then  at the beginning of winter  then switched back to regular tires at the beginning of spring keep in mind that almost everyone drove rwd cars in those days fwd didnt become widely available until the 70s  awd was available only on trucks until the 90s    i remember that dad always made the switch to snow tires on the friday after thanksgiving    something else to remember is that your regular tires will last that much longer if youre running with winter tires during the cold weather months so the total ownership cost is less than you think    given that tires are the only part of your car that actually touches the road do you really want to cheap out on them think about it if you cant afford top quality rubber for your car you might be better off riding the bus,jimbres
2801,October 2010,sure winter tires are not exactly known for smooth ride and low noise level so why would i want to deal with that from decmar ill take the smoothermore quiet ride all season tires offer,smarty666
2802,October 2010,research by many companies has shown that the 6spd does not sell well on many cars that is the reason nissan stopped offering it on the nissan there was not enough demand for it and they were losing money no the manual models you can get a manual on the infiniti just like on the tl now so you have options if you want manual they are just much more limited then if you wanted automatic    i said acura sales have been pretty good so i dont know why you want numbers on why its tanking confuse    i want them to keep the vq engines as well bc i agree they are a performance beast it is m hope diamler and mercedes benz will be able to just help nissan quiet them down a bit at idle etc so they are more refined sounding,smarty666
2803,October 2010,well despite not getting winter tires i have always tried to get some of the best all season tires for road grip handling etc to compensate and most have done pretty well its not that big of a deal for me bc i will not drive on the road with more than a few inches of snow its just nice to have the awd so that i dont get stuck at work or anywhere if im not home when a winter storm or blizzard starts,smarty666
2804,October 2010,sure winter tires are not exactly known for smooth ride and low noise level so why would i want to deal with that from decmar ill take the smoothermore quiet ride all season tires offer     bzzzt im sorry that is incorrect ive driven cars with a dozen different winter tires over the last few years and to a one the tires were easily as quiet as the rubber used on the car for the other three seasons that and in most cases they rode smoother smoother you ask yes smoother why because typically when one buys a winter wheeltire set they minus one on the size my 530i is a good example the summer tires were 23545 subaru7s while the winter tires were 22555 subaru6s and the taller sidewall of the winter tires afforded a cushier ride,shipo

2807,October 2010,i dont know why you guys are making a big deal about this winter tire bs did you ever think maybe some people have special situations that would preclude them from doing so    not only do i not want to spend the money on a second set a tires i only use a few months out of the year ive had 3 back surgeries and major back problems and would break my a trying to lug tires in and out of car to go have them put on the car twice a year and lug them down stairs for storage the rest of the year i spent enough money on tires and back surgeries that i dont need to go and screw up my back just to get winter tires put on my car    its much easier just to get awd and it works fine for me and a lot of other people so live with it    plus i cant speak for other northern area of the country but i know that all the infiniti dealers and bmw dealers around where i live only have awd versions on their lots the only way you can get rwd only is by special ordering one once in a while you might get lucky and see a rwd only on the lot but usually the service departments snatch them up as service loaners,smarty666
2808,October 2010,steady there big guy were just trying to educate you no need to get excited,jimbres
2809,October 2010,the only way you can get rwd only is by special ordering one    so since i prefer to do european delivery and save thousands of dollars in the process i have to order anyway thinking about this further since ummm 1979 weve ordered 8 of our 13 cars including both of our rwd bmw one ed one not,shipo
2810,October 2010,being from upstate ny i can mostly agree with the amount of awd models on the local lots but there are still rwd models available without having to specialorder them and theyre not only base models with no options either    as far as winter tires are concerned granted each area has a different climate but when you live in an area that averages over 150 of snow per year and when it can fall at rates of 46 per hour winter tires are a must i lose count of how many different awd vehicles suvs cars etc that end up being buried in a roadside ditch simply because their allseasons cant keep up with the conditions people tend to forget that awd only helps with acceleration but does nothing in terms of steering or stopping on slippery roads given a choice id take a vehicle with winter tires over any awd vehicle with allseason tires no matter which set of wheels are actually attached to the drivetrain    and iirc there are some local dealers that actually store the winter tireswheels for you when theyre not needed and will swap out the 3season wheelstires and store them in the winter months for a fee of course,mz6greyghost

2815,October 2010,very good points and like you said if there is enough snow sleet or god forbid ice on the ground no awd or winter tires will save you    luckily down here in nj while we get our fair share of snowfall its nothing in comparison to what you guys in upstate ny get,smarty666
2816,October 2010,a point you might be missing is for lack of a better phrase not all snow sleet and even ice is created equal there are plenty of winter conditions where dedicated winter tires will find a fair amount of traction where even the best allseason tires will find virtually none,shipo

2822,November 2010,it doesnt include maintenance if you havent had it done at the dealership and they dont take the freaking paperwork that you have as proof when you return your vehicle back in i have had it happen with infiniti mb and caddy acura was the only one who took my maintenance records when i returned the vehicle    here is your proof for alg residual value since you have to be such a pestering noob about it it will be interesting to see how you twist and turn this link and its information to suit your own purpose    httpswwwalgcomresidualvalueawards    infiniti actually took the top spot from acura who has had it for the last two years good for infiniti    seriously what is wrong with you that you dont get what im saying i have leased many luxury vehicles and some of the makes dont even collect maintenance records i didnt have the stuff done at the dealership even if a computer records it there is no way for the computer to know what grade type content of fluids andor gas someone is putting in    i do have to say that not all cpos are equal i know acura and bmw have some stringent cpo standards compared to the rest when i turned my acura in they wanted all my maintenance records which i happily gave them others were much more lazy and didnt really care about the maintenance of the vehicle as long as it passed the return inspection and nothing was severely damaged infiniti mb and caddy were the biggest culprits of this    talk about the kettle calling the pot black you complain about the fact that i supposedly say all vehicles when in actuality i say either most or some which is not all and then you cant leave acura owners alone bc of your sour experience with them and that all their products arent great and you cant figure out why people are choosing them over others and again i said most of the ones i see does that mean all vehicles no so stop putting words in my mouth and twisting around what i say    im talking about the cpo vehicles ive seen on all the luxury manufacturers lot that have really worn faded sometimes severely wrinkled interiors there are some that are not like that i never implied that all cpos are like that or said that but there are some that dealers think are acceptable when they really arent and still put them out on the lot without doing a lot of cleaning and reconditioning to them    i state facts man unlike you who sole goal on edmunds is to argue with people sick,smarty666

2850,December 2010,much as it did that winter nightmorning in buffalo during the late fall of 1996 i was at a cliub with some friends in buffalo i went to college about 2 12 hours away in ithaca my friend who i was visiting and at the club with was in a shall we say intoxicated state and getting very friendly with a 6 tall blonde at about 330 am i decided i had had enough and wanted to go back to his place to crash    chris give me your keys ill meet you back at your place later call me if you need a lift    with the flick of his wrist he tossed me the keys to his 1995 e36 bmw 325is redblack leather 5 speed manual transmission hk sunroof  most importantly sport package  additional factory lowering    now up until this point i was a novice at driving stick and had never had any real seat time in a bmw i thought they were for show offs my entire point of view changed by the time i took off from the 1st traffic light i had never driven a car that i just felt so perfect in i drove the car around the streets of buffalo for the next 2 12 hours by the end of the night i was steering around right turns with the throttle  rotating around corners perfectly ive wanted a bmw ever since    fast forward to december 2 2010 the numbers dont mean a whole helluva lot bmw gets good money for their cars and they are worth every penny    ive got my moms 08 e90 bmw 328xia almost 61000 miles until saturday even saddled with all wheel drive  automatic transmission it is still a true drivers car you all know how much i love my 01 prelude type sh almost 132000 miles my moms bmw is one of the few cars ive driven that almost make my prelude feel loose    the drive from my parents house in rockland county ny to my house in stamford ct changed my mind and reinacuraated my passion for bmw id take a bmw with its 230 horsepower no nav leatherette sports package  6 speed stick it is just an amazing car to drive i would even consider a cpo or private party used as long as the person has service records  the car passes a ppi and ive only owned new cars my entire driving life since i got my license  2001 prelude type sh 2015 infiniti q40 awd 2017 honda honda touring awd,nyccarguy
2851,January 2011,it may not be quickest in the 14 mile but the acura with 4 cylinder engine and 6 speed manual is a delight to drive and most definitely is an ellps,fedlawman
2852,January 2011,sadly only 5 of the acura market is sold in 6 speed form,sweendogy
2853,January 2011,if one wants a manual transmission its time to go to work theyre rarely stocked and when they are theyre liable to be loaded with s lets say stuff that i dont want when i got mine i checked inventories all over the west and finally ended up paying the local dimwits to truck one in from denver that i couldnt see once that happens serious bargaining goes out the window    either way i have my manual and i enjoy it    point being if none are available for test drives most people will give up the same thing happens with bmw among others    chicken  egg,cdnpinhead
2854,January 2011,my experience back in 04 was just the opposite    i wanted a 325i and tried to find one with just the sport package and manual transmission and couldnt find anything that wasnt fully loaded    then having read the favorable magazine reviews i test drove the acura infiniti and that was it  i never looked back it was so tossable and playful and had the slickest shifter and sweetest revving engine i had ever experienced  nicer even than the also excellent bmw    ironically i was totally satisfied with it until i took it to a couple of bmw club track days where btw i was able to keep pace with e46 330is and e36 bmw and decided that i wanted rwd    except for it being fwd the acura has almost the perfect mix of sportiness luxury and refinement it was simply a pleasure to own  and for 90 of drivers who dont take their cars to lapping days fwd is no handicap,fedlawman
2855,January 2011,coupes dont sell  thats why honda killed off cars like the cl acura  my beloved prelude another 50 horsepower the v6 acura gets you an additional 80 or a turbo gives you way too much torque to drive the front wheels the 200 horsepower  175 lbft of torque are perfectly mated to acuras fwd platform the numbers dont tell the whole story  2001 prelude type sh 2015 infiniti q40 awd 2017 honda honda touring awd,nyccarguy
2856,January 2011,another 50 horsepower the v6 acura gets you an additional 80 or a turbo gives you way too much torque to drive the front wheels the 200 horsepower  175 lbft of torque are perfectly mated to acuras fwd platform    maybe you think 250 hp is too much to drive the front wheels but i beg to differ    ive got 272 hp going to the front wheels of my mazdaudi and its just right ive suffered no torque steer even when exiting a tight corner the only tug ive felt with a fwd v6 is with an nissan 35se i tested a few years ago    ive even driven the acura v6 and felt that the power was nice with no noticeable torque steer cant say that for the 4cylinder even with a manual the power was adequate but still felt noticeably weaker compared to the g and 3series and i wasnt about to drop 36k on a fwd sedan just for the v6 which imo is way overpriced just to get a bigger engine,mz6greyghost
2857,January 2011,the 6spd is slowly being introduced right now the zdx and acura have it and in a few months the tl will have it with the 2012 update i suspect that the acura will get it in the next year or two,smarty666
2858,January 2011,honda didnt kill off the honda and honda coupeduring that time nissan introduced the pontiac5 coupe and now an nissan coupe lexus has the lexusc bmw continues to make a 3 and 6 audi the audi mbusa yep they have a few as well if they sold a acuralike coupe it would outsell the zdx and rl combined i understand the acura is a great fwd car and numbers dont tell the whole story but the point is they need to step it up a bit,sweendogy
2859,March 2011,for a audi forum i love how the acura has taken over    i never understood why acrua thought they needed a v6 in the acura never made sense if they wanted more hp then take the turbo engine from the acura and make it a low pressure turbo engine say in the 220230 hp range this would give the acura more hp without having some of the fwd turbo issues add a real sport package to the car 6 spd manual and wham got yourself a great car    being back in school for my masters i needed to lower my monthly payments on my car so i went with a 2010 ford ford se with 6 spd manual and the appearance package also known as sport package have to say its a lot of fun to play with i got 23540hsubaru8 tires slightly lower suspension and taunter suspension all for 24k otd it has a bigger back seat then the acura and living here in phoenix the last thing i want in the summer time is leather    but ill be looking for a new 2012 audi once im done with school the back seat is bigger then the acura bmw or c class,flightnurse

2862,June 2011,im in the market for a car and since time is on my side ive been looking at a leisurely pace    my short list is the infinitix with plan b being the lexus lexus and plan c being the 335    in my heart the 335 is actually at the top of the list but since im buying its slightly out of my price range    i rented a infiniti on vacation this year and was pleasantly surprised about how much better it was then the last pontiac5 i drove,kdshapiro
2863,June 2011,i have driven numerous pontiac5s and 1 infiniti  i have a bmw on order  for european delivery  in september  good luck wyour quest   ray  one data point  2016 bmw 340i,rayainsw
2864,June 2011,although the infiniti is more engaging to drive than the lexus youll tire quickly of the intrusiveness loud growl of the engine etc of the infiniti unless youre planning a lease the relatively poor resale of the infiniti is also a negative    personally id go for the bmw also for hts and giggles drive the volkswagen cc you might be pleasantly surprised,carnaught
2865,June 2011,coworker took me on a two mile trip in the cc i couldnt wait to get outblah another coworker took me to lunch in his audi 4 20 t i felt like i was on a nyc subway during rush hour car was cdodgeped its worst than my 99 millennia,billyperks2
2866,June 2011,you may have to do some more uptodate research before commentingthe resonant tailpipe tone on my infiniti coupe is intentional the resale for my leased infiniti is 56 percent which i understand is great for this segment infiniti has more features is more reliable plus alot less costly to own than lexus or bmw volkswagen cc   come on it isnt even close to an infiniti in quality the lexus is a car for grandpa the lexus is actual a better competitor to the bmw acura tl and the infiniti than the es  350 i laugh everytime one of my buddies takes his bmw in for repairs or maintenance after 50kits a joke dont take my word for it competitive info is all over the internet and this site,littlejoe613
2867,June 2011,the growl of the engine in the infiniti is different than the resonance from the tailpipe its the vqs unrefined and rough sounding nature at higher revs that makes you think its going to throw a rod every time you get it above 5000 rpm    bmw inline 6 is one of the sweetest sounding smoothest revving engines on the planet and its well worth the premium in price to have it,fedlawman
2868,June 2011,you know you are getting the bmw kdshapiro an lexus  2001 prelude type sh 2015 infiniti q40 awd 2017 honda honda touring awd,nyccarguy
2869,June 2011,unrefined i laugh at that the engine has been a work horse for nissan for yearshas won engine of the year multiple times over in prev variations  it throws out 330 hp and gets ok fuel economy its not a bmw engine no but its not unrefined  drive a base dodge dodge and youll worry about throw a rod as you try to get on a local on dodgep infiniti might be louder then bmw but again its different  i think infiniti was going for more of a muscle car sound at open throttle we all can agree bmw is ahead when it comes to the class but infiniti is not far behind given the price points the power the sporty nature and quality    i own a infiniti pontiac5x from 2007 actually looking for bmw 335xi sport 6 speed manual and would not be if infiniti put a 6 speed in awd form,sweendogy
2870,June 2011,ya know ive been a member of edmunds since 1999 in the 12 years since i have joined a lot has changed in my life    at this point i am looking for a comfortable chrysler with decent gas mileage    in my quest i decided to lowball the dealers because i am ready to take delivery with the right price if i cant get the deal i want for the specific car ill move on to the next manufacturerdealer    as far as the lexus it is way to small for me at this point in time,kdshapiro
2871,June 2011,i notice you had the lexus as a possible but not the 2012 tl a lot of people are turned off by the styling which started in 2009 and that may be the reason however the 2012 has smoothed out lines and a lot better looking grill its probably right in between the g and the es as far as ridehandling goes and gets 20city29hwy with the new 6spd auto trans on the front wheel drive version which imo is pretty good for a roomy luxury car,m6user
2872,June 2011,i am turned off by acuras styling direction maybe ill look at the 2012 i am not a fan of the front grille at all its way worse than the bangled up 745s which i kind of liked but everybody else hated,kdshapiro
2873,June 2011,hear ya but they really did tone down the grill a bunch i didnt like the styling either until i saw the 2012 at the auto show now the car is on my short list,m6user
2874,June 2011,you may have to do some more uptodate research before commentingthe resonant tailpipe tone on my infiniti coupe is intentional the resale for my leased infiniti is 56 percent which i understand is great for this segment    hmm i wasnt aware that i had to do research to your standards in order to comment here thanks for the advice but ive done the researchand i owned a 2009 infiniti coupe while reliable the intentional as you call it tailpipe tone was just plain annoying as for resale you can quote any number you can dig up but what counts is what a person can actually get for their car in the real world and it was not great    with 4 bmw owned sorry to disappoint you but they all were hyundai in terms of their lack of repair issues ill take any of them over the two infinitis ive owned or the two my son has had    my bringing up the volkswagen cc was mainly in response to kds mentioning of the lexus lexus not every car we become interested in have to be mts or the roadburning classic enthusiast cars    ultimately the comments we chevrolet here are based on our opinions and even though you may not agree with them mine count as much as yours or anyones shades ,carnaught
2875,June 2011,im drooling good luck with your quest,kdshapiro
2876,June 2011,with 4 bmw owned sorry to disappoint you but they all were hyundai in terms of their lack of repair issues    ditto except ive owned ninecurrently have 3 in my garage the poster child for mechanical issues and high repair costs has been my 2007 mazdapeed 3  mine 1995 318ti club sport  2014 m235i  1999 wrangler  1996 speed triple challenge cup replica wifes 2016 i3 rex2009 cooper clubman sons 2009 bmw,roadburner
2877,June 2011,actually he is right on the resale values infinitis have gotten consistently high ratings for resale value from several professional sources one being alg i think infiniti actually won the alg residual value award this year from acura which had it the last two years    btw  if you trade your car into a dealership no matter what make it is your going to get hosed on what you get for it but if you sell it privately youll be able to use the high resale value to your advantage,smarty666
2878,June 2011,please dont deal in facts it confuses people,m6user
2879,June 2011,btw  if you trade your car into a dealership no matter what make it is your going to get hosed on what you get for it but if you sell it privately youll be able to use the high resale value to your advantage    this is cartrading 101 which probably having bought and sold more than most i am well aware of thanks shades     btw i got hosed selling both my two infinitis so if youre thinking youre going to get what the published numbers are you will be sadly mistaken in the real world  my car sales were to private owners and took many weeks and hard negotiations to come to fruition again real world market place guyshope i dont confuse you confuse ,carnaught
2880,June 2011,well my computer died yesterday in the middle of my response so here goes again holding fingers    i was in the exact same situation as you about half a year ago my parents have reached the age where they can get us kids to to the shopping and testing for themthough we have kids as well  heh cpo 12 years old was also an option    anyways the short list was the acura the c class the cts the infiniti and the lexus350    acura  this came in last place it suffers from front wheel drive and while it is pretty inside it still has a noisy engine and a feel to it that is pretty normal and the looks arent that great it has that smiley face look that only the japanese can pull off    lexus350  had a lot of the same issues as the acura just sort of meh though a very nice and pretty car overall but it lacked something identifiable as a soul or a personality like going to cold stone and getting just vanilla ice cream sure its superb but even the most awesome vanilla is still vanilla the prices of the acura and is also seemed a bit inflated    so that left the infiniti pontiac the c350 and the cts    the infiniti was good but it really has an odd feel to it  its a young persons weekend racer in a business suit it doesnt feel as polished or refined as it should be and perhaps thats because it is based upon the z it also has that dolledup feel to it i guess it was sitting in the m next to it that reinforced to me how big of a difference there was between luxury and just looking like it youd figure that an auto manufacturer would build a smaller version of its better cars instead of pimping out a lower brand    great car to drive though just was missing something its kind of how i describe the volvo volvo and audi audi  close but still feels off    it boiled down to two choices that were an absolute tie the c class and the cts    the cts was what they eventually settled upon but only because of the gm dollars that he had it is a fantastic car allaround the car drives great handles great and has a very nice interior its by far the best thing gm has ever made    my personal favorite though was the new model c350 it felt just about perfect in how it drove the interior was also perfect as well  great seats and you could tell that it was really a smaller version of the e class and s class id rate it as a slightly softer road feel of the 3 series both are within a few percent of each other but the edge for luxury goes to mercedes benz the edge for performance goes to bmw  note  the new e class sedan is based largely upon the c class  if you want something larger that is,plekto
2881,September 2011,well this is kind of to be expected since it is the new honda after all    yes there is no acura in japan its sold as the honda over there they ship the same car over here and slap an acura badge on it and add a lot of markup    what we get as the honda over here is actually an inbetween model that theyve never sold in the us before its called the inspire in japan    its also why the acura simply doesnt belong in this discussion as well its kind of like how cadillac tried to push the catera as a luxury car years ago when it really was a compact commuter box with some bling and badges added,plekto
2882,September 2011,agree with everything youve said i think we can create an entire thread to this one discussion what is an entry level performance sedan    for those of us that like to argue in circles    we could easily argue why kia and volkswagen should be ahead of many of these    of course this always touches on raw emotionsyour car is not good enoughits a chick carwhich borders on mother comments,ivan_99
2883,September 2011,i actually drove a loaded v6 honda back to back with the same car over here with an acura badge on it    their price tags were remarkably similar i know underneath my acura sits on the honda platform and is sold in europe as an honda    besides the v6 honda extra punch i prefered everything about the acura the suspension tuning is sportier on the acura my acura has thicker antiroll bars the seats are comfortable and very thickly bolstered it drives like a 4 door version of my 2001 honda prelude type sh for a fwd platform they did a damn good job is it a 3 series no did i like it better than the audi 20t w audi i drove yes does it belong in this discussion absolutely  2001 prelude type sh 2015 infiniti q40 awd 2017 honda honda touring awd,nyccarguy
2884,September 2011,i love acurashonda but the acura is not entry level luxury it sits between everyday family sedan honda toyota and the entry level luxury tl audi 3series not quite there yet,billyperksii
2885,September 2011,you could say the same thing about the 3 series leather is optional on the 3 as well as many things that are standard on the acura acura is a luxury brand acura is the entry level car at acura what part of entry level is so hard to understand the acura fits the definition perfectly the infiniti is the entry level at infinti and the audi at audi hp is about the same as as well and without turbocharging the skyline is a family sedan in japan but the same car here is a luxury sport sedan infiniti i dont think anyone argues that the g series is not an entry level luxury sedan,m6user
2886,September 2011,pricewise the 328 you bought and the c350 are comparable if you cant drive a 2011 off the lot for under 40k right now you need to go to another dealer but yeah some mb dealers dont deal much they just dont need to but the engine while nice wasnt what sold me its for my wife so it is not much about the engine    we like everything else i sort of understand the bimmer its kind of glued to the ground but it just felt heavier where the mb felt spry light on its feet but very directable and responsive the bimmer didnt fell any faster and i drove it fast on traffic circles etc    the bmw interior was just not good at all the dash alone took it right off our list what are they thinking with respect to competition so dated i will give the audi this  its interior was better than the bmw but the driving feel and interior did not flow    i recall the audis interiors easily being industry leading from the early 90s until the early 2000s dont know what happened but the interior now reminds me of mid90s volkswagen which was pretty nice but audis are not what they used to be theres no art to them    btw the sport package on the mb includes a lowered suspension and a stiffer suspension not much else except as you note styling but the styling is youthful nearly all the sell are the sport version the salesman said they dont even order the c in the luxury version same with the eclass      glad to hear your happy with your bimmer theyre are many bmw in my neighborhood lot of men and women have them only a couple of mbs i think the crowd in their 30s like the image bmw portrays certainly more younger that mb styling is good on many models no problem with that i like german car handling and design intent i say buy whatever turns your crank,wireless
2887,September 2011,sounds like you and your wife are more impressed with bells and whistles than the driving experience nothing wrong with that but the new kia kia blows the luxury class away with cabin toys    bmw appeal to a sportier driving populace that cares less about handbag hooks than they do about performance on a twisty road,shabadoo25
2888,September 2011,agreed cars like the acura infiniti etc all belong in this discussion because they are entry level luxury sedans they have four doors and come from luxury divisions and hence why the auto industry classifies them as such just because someone else doesnt think so does not make it so let them keep telling themselves that,smarty666
2889,September 2011,i suppose that makes some sense    its a grey area with me    when i see entry level luxury performance sedan i dont automatically think of the lowest model that a manufacturer offers    so id say no to the acura lexus infiniti etcthe tl would be the representative for acuras entry level the lexus would represent lexus infiniti etc    i dont recallis there a price cap otherwise would the panamera be the entry level,ivan_99
2890,September 2011,no the car was on the lot reason why i got the deal was people who get 328s want an auto this car had been sitting on the lot for a while infact you cant order 2011s only 2012s,flightnurse
2891,September 2011,there is more to the free maintenance then what you are writing it also comes with a bumperto bumper warranty too so everything is covered except gas tires and insurnace my 2005 bmw 330i with the zph package was used hard and the clutch was replaced without a problem from bmw as well as brakes its nice to be able to drive in and drive out with a loaner bmw and have your car worked on for nothing bmw has done it right its keeps the cars uptodate on its services so the value of the car keep says high    next year we are ordering a bmw and doing the european delivery so we can enjoy the car in the motherland,flightnurse
2892,September 2011,well hondaing to auto industry the acura is an entry level luxury car the tl is not an extry level car period if the lexus is an entry level car look at the price of the lexus and acura very similar,flightnurse
2893,September 2011,bmw has made leather standard for the 2011 my go to their web site and build a 3 series bmw took away the standard moonroof but added leather its part of the value package that is standard,flightnurse
2894,September 2011,good catch i havent stayed on top of the absolute latest bmw info since im not all that interested in them so i wont be digitally building one thats the way it was for years and i just hadnt read anything about the change i stand corrected on that,m6user
2895,September 2011,do you think leather is better than leatherette i would say yes but recently reconsidered leather especially not topoftheline premium leather degrades after four or five years depending on conditions of course leatherette can be cleaned with 409,wireless

2898,September 2011,its been a while since my last post i have a 07pontiac5x and i love it but have always wanted an awd sedan with a stick shift g awd is auto only and at the time when i bot it in 2007 i could not justify buying the bmw 335xi for a cool 12grand more the g had more hp great styling and great driver set up with the nav and premium packages well lets fast forward  my g has only 28000 miles on it and i still have the craving to drive stick again problem being is buying a cpo 335 2009 or newer with 6 speed sedan with awd and the sport package problems cant find them when you do they have more miles then my current car even 2010s and most of all pricing the 2009 are going for 36k or more,sweendogy
2899,September 2011,well this tells you that people who own the bmw you are looking for drives them is that a bad thing no you cant compare apples and oranges here you will have to be happy with what ever car you get if you arent happy with a bmw of your liking with more miles then your current car then stop looking for a used car get a new one or just wait it out and see if you found one with less miles    the cpo bmw is an excellent deal 6yr or 100k with free maintence cant beat it    if infiniti really wanted to go after bmw they would copy bmw play book which is offer your entry level g with a sport package and 6 spd manuel,flightnurse

2903,September 2011,ive recently driven each of the cars that are considered in this category and i cant yet make a decision since this is my first foray into luxury i really didnt want to find myself regretting my choice in cars i set out to look at the acura lexus bmw audi  infiniti after reading some things i added the c300 to the list which youll hear about i am looking for peoples input into my decision as im still unsure and id like to hear how youve liked the brand you chose and its cost to own im scared about ending up with an endless pit of cash to maintain a car and id rather not feel the road which sounds redundant owning a small car but if i can feel every bump then i may as well buy another toyota and deal with the potholes in jersey    i was most hopeful going in about the is from lexus but found the car to be an exact duplicate of my current toyota from 2005 i hit my head on the roof while driving im only 6ft tall and im a big guy but the cabin felt cdodgeped every time i talked to the salesman he acted like i was making a mistake not buying a bigger car do no salesman just listen to what youre saying about preference that car is now off the list and will remain there    i drove the infiniti and thought it was a very nice car it felt classy inside and i guess sterile is the word that comes to mind i actually liked it and liked that it was a bit bigger in the backseat than most in this group i hate the idea that driving a small car means you cant drive more than 2 adults around it was about 35 fully loaded with the backup camera and nav and awd which is cheaper than the competitors i didnt like the salesman and his pushiness but that wont totally sway my decision i think it drove ok although not as well as the audi bmw or the mb additionally my mechanic loves these cars and says they are the most reliable im a bit unsure still though because i dont want nissan parts in my luxury car its still on the list if i cant justify the extra 5k or so then ill end up in infiniti if i had to guess,jerseyguy77
2904,September 2011,i next drove the acura i thought the acura felt like an honda im not sure if there is a significant difference in the parts between them but it didnt feel very luxury i liked that most of everything was included as it didnt feel like you were getting ripped off for everything i liked that it had a backup camera the only real option with the nav system and i definitely liked that the car cost less than its competitors i just dont think im going to be able to get off of the lack of feel unless it becomes a numbers play in which case this will definitely be in the discussion as it is significantly less expensive    i drove the audi next and really liked the experience i take some confidence in the fact that they have been doing awd longer than anyone else i also like they seem to think about what youd like to be able to see which youre driving without having to jump through hoops i thought their nav was more intuitive than the others i saw the ride was also smooth and fluid but i didnt really get to open it up due to the traffic and the flooding around me i am probably going to retry the test drive at another dealership to get a different experience my concerns were that i have no idea whether you can negotiate a price on these it was listed as 42ish for the model id want the back seat looked really small and i was surprised at how wide the car was for the small car of the group they seem to be wide i dont want to end up driving my wifes nissan which looks puffy instead of a small luxury cari definitely would put them at the top of my choice so far though unfortunately if it was that clear cut i wouldnt be asking for input from you fine folks,jerseyguy77
2905,September 2011,i drove the bmw next which was always at the top of my list i figure it cant be on the top of this segment every year for no reason right ill start by saying i wasnt happy that it gets worse gas mileage than the others id tried up to this point what i mean by that is to get the same gas mileage i have to avoid the awd which is supposed to make the bmw great i figured that they would try to make that equal i also was a little taken aback by the pompousness of the salespeople who i dealt with they were basically like the other peoples cars could never do this and they proceeded to drive around a racetrack they had built to show the cars handling im pretty sure that the audi and mb just to start could do that type of driving if i wanted it toi mean theyre both cut from a similar cloth otherwise i did like the car i thought the navigation system looked like it wasnt made to be in the car it did feel much more like a sports car than the others i had driven since i drove it on a test track i will be going to a different dealer so that i can drive it on a road with potholes and other bumps to see how it feels the car has significantly more options and colors than the others in this category which i appreciate because i dont want a whiteredgreyblack car i want a nice color blue and unfortunately the other dealers have never seemed to want to make more than standard dark blue its kind of ridiculous also assuming that all else is equal i do think the extended warranty offered by bmw is huge i would love to not have to pay 50 for every oil change even if i am paying that a bit upfront    the last car i drove which i may drive again is the c300 i didnt have this on my list at all as i had heard terrible things about mb over the last few years in regards to reliability and design i wanted to try the car however as most who i know whove tried it mentioned that it was much better at hiding the bumps in the road which is a big deal in north jersey as i mentioned in my first post if i wanted to feel every bump in the road i would just buy another toyota in the smaller car segment you feel everything in most cars which i hate even though i will only drive a small car i thought the car was very nice as nice as the audi in my experience and i thought there was a very expensive feel to the drive i didnt significantly notice the cloud feeling while driving but i think that had to do with expectations versus results they are adding a blue color in 12 that i want to see because that may put this ahead again though the cost may be prohibitivewell see    id really love anyones input into what decisions you made and why on these models i will probably be making a decision over the next month or so,jerseyguy77
2906,September 2011,ive driven all the cars you are considering except the mb all are nice cars but i would rate them infiniti and bmw 328 a tie for first and then the audi    the infinitis seem to be the most reliable all 3 handle well i dont like the bmw interior since it seems dated the audi and g have a cleaner looking interior i dont care for the run flat tires on the bmw but some like them the deals are better on the infinitis now unless you currently own a bmw or audi and qualify for a loyalty incentive love the size and exteriors of all 3    i own 2 pontiac5s now and the back seats do not fold down which is a negative the bmw does not fold down unless you pay for a 400 option for the folding seat    that is why i am probably buying an infiniti ex 35 awd the ex is actually 5 inches shorter than a infiniti so some describe it as a combination of a crossover and a coupe it has the reliablity performance handling good looks and the ability to haul a bit albeit a small amount but way more than the infiniti the ability to fold down the seats in the ex is huge with me    some reviewers felt that the ex had a smoother ride than the infiniti    there is also a 2000 incentive on the ex so it may be the least expensive of the bunch    when you test drive the right car you will hopefully know it as i did the ex just felt the best although it may not be considered a sedan by some but an argument can be made that it is    actually my favorite handling car was the bmw 328xi sport wagon e91 but the interior was very unattractive and really dated this clearly is not a sedan though but i liked the storage utility smallish size and again handling    good luck with your search,2233
2907,September 2011,i do think it would be worth your time  to test drive a cts  reading between the lines in addition to  what youve written here the cts may  be more to your liking  just my 02 gallons worth of advice   ray  picking up a new 3 series on friday  2016 bmw 340i,rayainsw
2908,September 2011,your take on the acura is interesting as the same vehicle is sold in japan with an honda badge on it its an evolutionary design if anything and not a real new model we get the top trim model honda sent over here and they slap some acura badges on it hence why its not really satisfying as a real luxury sport sedan    the is has the same problem in that it shows its toyota dna all too well    the infiniti as well cant hide the fact that its a pimpedout nissan    id also recommend taking a serious look at the cts its one of two vehicles that gm makes that are worldclass the rest yes its typical beancounting gm idiocy and blandness id not recommend anything else they build the other vehicle is sold in australia unfortunately    pros  cost to repair is less than the european models about the same as the imports which have crept up in price without most people noticing    ride is designed with us drivers and roads in mindnote  avoid the performance model as the tires are lower profile than necessary its a bit stiff as expected but handles long road trips without any faults    the interior is very nice who knew gm could actually make an interior that didnt suck the nav system is actually very good comparing the nav system in the mercedes benz to the cts is like comparing a tv dinner to real food the cts it just works    headroom and overall space is good one thing about it thats great is that its actually the same wheelbase size as a e class or 5 series but the sheet metal is artfully done in such a way that it hides its size and looks a bit smaller    and as a bonus it doesnt look like everyone elses jellybean honestly you cant tell a infiniti from a hyundai from a mazda from two blocks away,plekto
2909,September 2011,i thought about the cts as well but it gets bad reviews on a couple of items poor rear visibility awkward driving position two items that are must haves for me and i would think most people i doubt ill ever sacrifice rearvisibility for style gm gets similar dings on the chevrolet,wireless
2910,September 2011,raygood point about the cts the one i drove coupe probably had the nicest interior this side of a maserati cadillac did an excellent job didnt care much for the seats but in and out the coupe is a stunning looking vehicle if i hadnt had a previously poor experience with a cadillac sts i might have considered one more seriously    that cts drives well too    having been through this test several months ago im probably going to go against the grain i drove both a c300 and a c350 really nothing special on eitherespecially for the price id much prefer an audi or an acura tl sh awd or a bmw over the mercedes benz e class wasnt bad but danpontiac0k for a little more sheet metal no thanks the c class was overpriced enough the e class even more they arent bad carsjust nothing id consider    if you want drivers cars probably stick to the bmw audi acura even the infiniti    all the above cars are built well with great materials    however if i were serious about a mercedes benz id probably look at the cts as it more closely resembles driving a mercedes benz but with a lot more style  2018 acura tchrysler sh awd aspec,graphicguy
2911,September 2011,thanks for the congrats  here is the buying story    i found a website called carwoocom  which for a one time fee allows you to locate and price a car without revealing your identity unlike competing web sites that do essentially the same thing carwoo takes money only from the buyer not from the seller unless of course they are lying i paid 148 which allowed me to send queries to every audi acura infiniti and volovo dealer in ohio kentucky and indiana i limited my selection to the dealers under 200 miles away from cincinnati    carwoo allows you to configure the car exactly as you want it and you get a text box to explain any flexibility you may have or anything you will not consider    you then press a button and wait about 24 hours for the carwoo email machine to start sending you links to your carwoo account with offers from dealers    to make a long story a bit shorter volvo responded quickly and would not budge off of a 1000 off msrp discount bzzz thanks for playing maybe next time    infiniti was pretty aggressive and two dealers offered me prices that almost had me saying yes    audi dealers responded oddly all of them saying they had no inventory and that any audi would have to be ordered one of them finally gave me a price but it was for 42 months not 36 or 39 and it began with a 7 for a sub 48000 audi for pitys sake    acura locally came in at best with a 65 discount off msrp columbia a columbus ohio dealer  lindsay acura  came in at 13 off msrp for a 2012 acura tl shawd advance with backup sensors which are about a 715 accessory heres the funny thing they sourced the car from columbia  i have the window sticker whatsupwiththat    the car was 499 per month  tax    i had driven all of the cars not a lexus or mb of any kind multiple multiple times and really liked the audi whats not to like i still have my 2009 for another 30 days the bmw7x and the tl shawd advance model likewise i thought the volvo volvo t6 was great fun i also had a chance to drive a premium audi s4 without the sport diff  aka no torque vectoring now that car was the most fun of all but in premium mode had much less content than the other cars i had tested plus is was mo money big time    truth be told in what was nearly a back to back to back experience i drove the audi the cadillac and the acura over the exact same route for about the exact same time speeds tunes on the sound system etc etc in one days worth of test drives    i am hoping not to receive a bunch of are you out of your mind posts but i will venture to say this  the acura tl shawd advance is very close in performance and overall character to an audi s4  and although very nice and perhaps dressier the cadillac cts4 36 with the 19 wheel performance option was the least inspiring of the bunch    now the acura tl shawd advance is no audi s4 i am not saying it is the s4 would be the winner but contented to match the acura was just shy of 12000 more and i could not muster the one that i drove which was not contented thusly into and out of corners that much quicker than i could the acura which may have had an advantage over the audi at the time since the acura had torque vectoring and the the audi did not moreover the audi did seem more prone to wallowing through corners as if it had more understeer than the acura which even though it was slower seemed perhaps better balanced than the audi    so i says to myself the acura as equipped to my tastes was just under 48000 including shipping but excluding tax and my price was about 8000 off of that  thank you carwoocom    no one else even came close    remember i was pricing an audi 20t prestige 8spd tip wsport package and wood which came in pretty close msrp wise to the acura the cadillac had attractive offers but other than its glizt left me thinking it was not forded on performance as much as the other guys and the cadillac had one thing missing that for me was a deal breaker  a 53000 cts does not have grab handles for the front seat passenger or driver all the other guys do  and i consider them essential basic standard normal and required how much do grab handles cost anyway  in a 53000 car maybe 50 what were they thinking and moreover cadillac in the 4door cts does not even offer a blind spot warning system  which came standard on both the audi and the acura at the trim levels i specd    so thus far i am missing the audi new car smell i miss automatic windshield wipers and bixenons but i rarely can turn on my high beams so that is not that big of a deal  and oddly enough i miss the audi needle sweep when i start the acura up    then i get on the highway and press my foot down arousing a 305hp 274 pound feet of torque super smooth engine watch the power shift from the front to the rear wheels and zip im at 80mph in a distance that seems not much longer than my driveway    loving the cooled seats and the best sound system i have ever heard in any car including the bo in audi which had been my previous fave    having said all of this  i probably still would have gone with the audi 20t prestige sport if it had come in at a price to match the acura    money talks as the saying goes   surprise,markcincinnati

2914,September 2011,markcool as nyc said great writeup    im mazdar with both columbia and hidy funny that hidy was trying to sell a car that was on columbias lot    interesting about carwoo also personally i dont care if dealers know my identity but i can see where if you didnt want to be bothered with having them contact you where it might be useful    anyway that tl is a very nice ride youll like it during the time you have it parked in your driveway    funny about audis when i was looking several months ago s4s were on my shopping list the cincinnati dealer told me they had such limited stock of everything because the factory wasnt shipping them as many cars that included their volume model the audi they had one s4 but it wasnt even close to what i was looking for and it was a demo    the audi store in dayton had one but it was a 2k mi tradein wonder how much of a bath that owner took who wanted the then new audi instead    beechmont had the best selection with 4 s4s at the time but like you i couldnt see where the price delta was worth it to pay that much more over the similar tl sh awd    bmw is offering to do a factory performance retrofit on my bmw which would up both the hp and the torque by about 7 understand i believe that bmw is stretching the truth about how much hp and torque the bmw motor is putting out in factory trim its a lot more the kicker i can do the facotry performance upgrade at my dealership complete with normal bmw warranty for 600    im debating if ill want it my cars already as fast as greased lightening how much more could i want but were talking 20 extra ponies here  2018 acura tchrysler sh awd aspec,graphicguy

2917,September 2011,marksorry about that seems ive talked to or visited every acura and bmw dealer within a 100 mile radius of cincinnati in the last couple of years they start to run together    im mazdar with lindsay too while ive not visited the store i had dealt with one of the sales people there who wasnt very good i was looking for a particular color combo he said he had it when i asked him for the vin he strung me along wanting me to come to the store to talk about the car i wanted to make sure they had the color combo before making a 90 minute drive i told him all it would take for me to drive up to visit him was the vin so i could confirm he had what i wanted he couldntwouldnt he wouldnt assure me of that    again congrats on the car its a very nice one that youre going to enjoy a lot    kyfdxheres the blurb on edmunds which my dealer confirms they can do    httpwwwinsidelinecombmw1seriesbmwoffersperformancepowerkitfosubaru35i andbmwhtml    i know the previous 135335 had the twin turbo n54 and the new ones have the twin scroll turbo n55 ive driven both the n54 had a bit of turbo lag not much but bmw overboosts it at higher rpm which is why the bmw is rated with more hp and torque than the n55 however i think both motors are under rated and put out more hp and torque than bmw says they do    that said im trying to decide if i want the extra hptorque that would essentially make my bmw coupe with the same engine performance as the bmw which is mighty good    but mine is really good to begin with im debating but probably will do it when i can schedule some time at the dealership to get it done who doesnt like more hp and torque shades    hows your new z4 btw did you ever post pics  2018 acura tchrysler sh awd aspec,graphicguy
2918,September 2011,maybe im confusing threads but if i recall correctly the discussion about how heavy cars have gotten included a reference to rwd sedans while im personally biased toward rwd vehicles i dont use my bias to exclude other drive layouts from the ellps segment    i didnt exclude fwd or awd cars its just that bmw earlier models set the standard for the class which led to the best example the e30 also volvo did make a 240 turbo which was nearly identical at the time that both were rwd was just because thats how they liked to make cars    but as far as weight 3500 lbs isnt sporty not when you add in fuel fluids a battery and normal stuff like a spare tire which arent part of the dry weight listed that adds another 200300 lbs or so conservatively then add in a typical driver and you can be at or near 4000lbs rolling down the road physics dictate that you cannot get a 2 ton anything to turn on a dime and actually be nimble    now compared by decades of sofa on wheels yes they could be described as sporty but theyre a far far cry from their original roots    oh i thought of another possible small sport sedan to add to the under 3000lbs list  the mini cooper s in fact this is a perfect example because on paper the turning radius is actually worse than a bmw vs 351 vs 362 ft but drive one and its a huge difference in how they actually move and handle    httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvtf4ywkwjlik  here is the bmw vs the cooper of note is the huge difference in slalom speeds weight is a huge problem that even better tires and rwd cant completely mitigate    in something like a acura well the slalom speed for a acura is 646 mph both edmunds same exact testing methods the original e36 bmw edmunds managed to get one to go 75mph through their slalom just a whole other planet compared to todays cars,plekto

2935,September 2011,i am pretty well convinced that my 2012 tl will outperform my 2009 audi 20t too the audi which has audi drive select can be put into dynamic mode and that makes the steering more responsive and the dampers more firm and the transmission shift at higher speeds it has 19 wheels with ultra high performance yoko sadvan  allseason tires 35 aspect ratio    it has rear wheel drive biased audi and last but not least has 211hp and 258 lb ft of torque with the power going through a 6 speed automatic tiptronic transmission    it the audi that is is and has been great fun to drive and it is confidence inspiring to the max    the tl isnt quite as hunkered down feeling but it is wider and has about a 1 shorter wheelbase it is nose heavier than the audi but not a whole lot rides on similar tires but not ultra high performance of 40 aspect ratio is front biased awd but also includes torque vectoring it feels a bit softer than the audi it is quieter and feels a bit larger  but it has 305hp and 274 lb feet of torque and when properly applied when cornering the damn thing seems to be able to magically go from a nose heavy understeering blob to an oversteering slightly taught tight curve carver    the audi probably can cut the corners about at the same speeds or maybe higher than the acura even without torque vectoring  but when coming out of the curve the 305hp allows the acura to always show the audi its tail lights    my audi all in was 49k msrp the acura just south of 48k  at these prices power rules and overall the acura is a very nice place to spend some time either behind the wheel or as a passenger enjoying the ventilated seats that the audi lacks    said it before irrational as it might be if the audi were the same lease price per month as the acura that is about 200 less i would have gone with another audi  just for that special something that only a german car seems to offer    irrational    couldnt see the price per month delta though and that seems rational i am overall quite pleased with the acura and if they continue to improve and move forward and keep their value prop well i could become a true believer    you know though any of these cars are pretty damn nice    surprise,markcincinnati
2936,September 2011,you know though any of these cars are pretty damn nice    thatwe absolutely agree upon    your tl my 3 the audisall of them do amazing things as they should at the price points they sell at    they do so dynamically comfortably    i know i averaged about 21 mpg on my tl sh awd im averaging about 24 mpg on my bmw which amazes me even more i dont baby my cars either    these cars have come far  2018 acura tchrysler sh awd aspec,graphicguy
2937,September 2011,graphicguy  markincincinati  i think the 2 major things youll both notice that are different between your current  former tl sh awd  current bmw  audi are    steering having never driven a tl sh awd just my 2010 acura i can tell you the electric power steering stinks road feel is nonexistant at low speeds at higher speeds it is really nice and tight though    brakes there is a reason that my acura is less expensive than pretty much every other car in this segment acura honda had to cut corners somewhere the brakes on my acura are terrible nothing at all like bmw right now brakes with their incredible pedal firmness  physics defying stopping ability    obviously power is different too marks acura is definitely faster than his former audi while graphicguys 335 has the ability to outrun pretty much 90 of the normal cars on the road  2001 prelude type sh 2015 infiniti q40 awd 2017 honda honda touring awd,nyccarguy
2938,September 2011,i had a 1998 audi 6 cyl and have an 05 tl differences between the two     tl has more electronic goodies but 7 year newer car   tl poorer handler wallows in turns   tls climate control much quieter   audi interior clearly nicer   audi control feel and driving feel clearly better   audi inspired much more passion   audi extremely expensive to maintain the few things that broke were a lot   acura has been outstandingly reliable and cheap to maintain,tlong
2939,September 2011,breaks are not the only thing that makes the acura acura less expensive 4 vtek which is in every other honda product prob being the biggest saver of money for the acura car lets not forget the honda platform its not really a sports sedan but more of a sporty sedan as 90 of them are sold with automatics same thing with the tl nice rig for sure but not a true sports sedan even in shawd form closest to the germans is infiniti by far rear wheel drive good breaks sports packages manual transmissions which are sadly going away  cars from the far east are closer then they have ever been but its going to be interesting to see what car companies do in the upcoming years as they need to keep up with mpg mandates  i know bmw will be bringing a 4cy to the states soon acura can use the turbo 4 it already produces infiniti will team with mb for its next line of engines should be interesting,sweendogy
2940,September 2011,i might be mistaken but off the top of my head the only other honda product that uses the exact same motor 24l  201 hp  176 lbft torque is the honda si    ill agree with you that under extreme circumstances my acura shows its honda platform roots we have some seriously twisty back roads here in southwestern connecticut theres one particular road where the sign shows s curves for 1 mile with a 15 mph suggested speed limit my acura shows the flaws in its chassis    like many here have said price aside id choose a bmw    every single car in this segment shines in its own way a 3 series equipped like my acura or even a tl costs significantly more has a smaller back seat  a smaller trunk    the 3 series is sharper handles better drives much better overall  2001 prelude type sh 2015 infiniti q40 awd 2017 honda honda touring awd,nyccarguy
2941,October 2011,imho where they should go from here is to the previous model acura which was great before they numbed and bloated it up    i agree,fedlawman
2942,October 2011,ive taken a couple of stabs at liking infinitis none of them ever made it to the top of my want it list i think they lack the refinement i got used to with acuras bmw etc    i think you hit the nail on the head    to me infinitis seem like second rate bmw the infiniti is fast and handles well but they havent nailed down the refinement    acura on the other hand stays true to being a characteristically japanese sportluxury car theres no attempt to try to be anything but what it is    by the way is that you over at avs talking about the 4311,fedlawman
2943,October 2011,hasnt nailed down refinement  i agree not as refined as an audi of bmw  and i do agree the acura is more refined like lexas then the infiniti g but interns of performance acura has nothing compared to infiniti acura stays true sure they are true to compete with the lexus es not bmw sorry way wrong they have not produced a car in 10 years that was sport nsx died a long time ago so did the acura sports claim i would also wonder what honda does with this brand no hybrid no coupe no convert no sports supercar no flagship sedan look at all the leaders audi bmw lexus they have all of these  acura not one this could be the next oldsmobile  write that down,sweendogy
2944,October 2011,i agree the price of the g has risen a little bit over the last few year but i dont agree that the best bang for your buck is the bmw yet that is the infiniti compares to the 335 and not the 328 if you did make the comparison you are your bmw is going to lack almost 100hp bixenon headlights navigation and a couple of other little toys and tech you only get in the 335 when ordered that your getting for the same price in the infiniti i do agree though that the bmw is more refined then the g but definitely not the best bang for the buck yet    im eagerly awaiting the next gen 2013 g and 3 series it should be interesting to see what infiniti and bmw do with their bread and butter vehicles,smarty666
2945,October 2011,stopped by to look at the g series today we were a little too ragged out to drive one    but they have decent lease deals 39mo39k lease on a infinitix with premium pkg msrp about 41k for 440motax with around 900 total due at signing add sport package for another 10mo    thats better than audi or bmw right now and 328 hp  moderator    prices paid lease questions suvs,kyfdx
2946,October 2011,yes the infiniti has 100 more hp but as i wrote what i paid for my 328 is very close to the base price of a infiniti there is no way you are going to get nav bixenon headlights or other goodies that i have on my 328 in that infiniti the base price for a infinitis is far more then what i paid for my bmw    now if one wants to compare the average price of a bmw to a infinitis the bmw is better value,flightnurse
2947,October 2011,which base did you beat the infiniti which is 37k even or the 41500 for a fully loaded infinitis you lost me because you mentioned bothwith haggling you can get a g for 24k off each car given the dealer how much did you pay was this a cpo    does your car have the sports package navi rear camera like the infinitis has  does your car have the headlights sunroof leather and paint 500bux extra for bmw that the infiniti base has    i dont have the avg price people are paying for the 335 or the infinitis but given the options that are standard on the g its got to be close to 8kmaybe morei own a g and want a 335,sweendogy
2948,October 2011,just did a quick build on each website and the 328xi comparably equippedas i could get was about 5k more than the infinitix plus you get the 100hp to boot with the g the 328 may be a little better driver and smoother runner but for value its hard to beat the g infinitis are extremely reliable and trouble free for the most part i have oneqx4 that is 9 years old and it has had only two repairsexhaust resonator and power antenna other than scheduled maint,m6user
2949,October 2011,nah they are taking 4k off a fully loaded infiniti at my two local infiniti dealers and ill bet it is similar in discounts your received on your bmw so the g still in all trims is a better bang for your buck then the bmw also a infiniti is fully loaded with nav sport etc for around 44k before any discounts it still undercuts the bmw in price as almost all the bmw my local bmw has are priced in the high 40s to low 50s the g even undercuts that price    im not saying the bmw or bmw are bad vehicles in fact i really liked them when i test drove both but they still dont compare to the bang for buck of g,smarty666
2950,October 2011,something i noticed this weekend when reading a somewhat favorable review of the 2012 acura tl they have a new 37l engine with 305 hp 6000 rpm and 273 poundfeet 5000 rpm    how is it that the mb c350 pretty much the same price has a 35l and it has 302 hp 6500 rpm with 273 poundft 3500 rpm one thing i would give honda is that they were always able to wring the hp out of their small engines even if they had to rev them to 9k rpms now they need an engine almost 6 larger just to match mb and the peak torque is at a relatively high 5k rpm,wireless
2951,October 2011,i think you are assuming too much each region is completely different when it comes to discount rebates leases and equipment i know here on the west side of the country infiniti is hurting for cars so discounts are far and few so when i do a comparison its done with the fact of what the prices were i live    the base price for a infiniti is 36k and it does not come with nav now to add the tech package to get nav and sport package is 41k this was more then my 328 with m sport package    the infiniti sport is 41k    just for the record my bmw is bmw with m sport package with value package which includes leather ipod connection free moonroof and access entry cost out the door was 37k this includes 4yr 50k of free maintenance and service i tend to run my bmw hard and go through brakes the clutch is covered under bmw warranty so if needed i wont have to pay anything something infiniti does not do,flightnurse
2952,October 2011,good luck with the bmw nice car with the m package if your looking at 6speed manuals which i love btw the infiniti fully loaded is 41k there is not add on packages to getwhats in the box is in the box if you get the g with the manual and your right certain areas are offer different discounts but you have to remember bmw 3 series is changing for 2012 and the company wants all stock out the door now the maintenance is interesting if you are like me and dont drive say 810k miles a year your looking at 1 tire rotation and 2 oilchanges a year and if you are looking at somewhat equal cars 335 the 5810k whatever the dollar amt is is not worth the free maintenace that all bmw owner crow about trust me i have the g and have spent 500 bux total in 4years they run like tops,sweendogy
2953,October 2011,having test driven the infinitix coupe and bought a bmw bmw i can say that the 3 has more hp than bmw is claiming plus its usable power all through the rev range the g is a good car but comparatively the 335 is very easy to drive very fast still not a bad car between the two    kyfdxi had mentioned you can get bmw factory performance upgrade for the 335 to add 20 hp for 600 i just got it done on friday made an amazing car amaziner  2018 acura tchrysler sh awd aspec,graphicguy
2954,October 2011,nice  moderator    prices paid lease questions suvs,kyfdx
2955,October 2011,nice graphguy i would do 600 bux for an extra 20hp that seems like a good deal at 320  claimed hp thats some major power but in reading articles its seems bmw is trying to move current inventory and using this as part of the bait to buy a 2011 so it seems the 2012 335 will haven even more hp keep going bmw cant wait to get my next g with 400 hp or more,sweendogy
2956,October 2011,i debated the upgrade i agree that bmw is readying for the new 3    but 20 hp is 20 hp i liked the car enough to buy it to begin with i like it more now  2018 acura tchrysler sh awd aspec,graphicguy
2957,October 2011,at the price point and at the class ellps we are talking about the value leaders remain infiniti and acura more content and by some definition im sure more car for the money when youre comparing infiniti to bmw which seems to be the comparison that everybody makes i think ill compare acura to audi for the time being  it seems somehow to work for me    the infinitixs was a car i wanted to like  but i was smitten with the bmw7x which seems to me to be priced lease price per month at about what an audi audi 20t prestige goes for or what a bmw 335 with bmw and a fair amount of options goes for the infinitixs after coming from an audi audi 2009 vintage seemed cdodgeped  too narrow and with apparently no expanse of hood to speak of    yet the g was pretty well loaded and was very spunky  gobs of power albeit with a little harshness as the rpms moved toward redline neither the audi or bmw engine seem harsh had the car been at least 2 wider i might have gone infiniti rather than acura i certainly feel infiniti as a brand has the lps vision whatever the hell that means whereas neither lexus nor acura seem to have much of a clue    but i got behind the wheel of the tl advance and it was wider i could see a hood out through the front window and there was no harshness in the engine compartment and the sound of the 37l at full cry is quite pleasing too bad the tl isnt quite as quick feeling as the g  but man the tl has the g in smoothness  the tl is like butta    i am growing slowly very slowly to accept the looks of the tl exterior i am pleased with the interior  the seats are almost audi quality and they are ventilated a must have i am almost embarrassed to say    the tl is  on paper  damn near the perfect definition of an ellps but only in advance trim or tech trim with a 6 speed based on reviews  and only if it is shawd equipped heres a 1500 mile review    smooth and quiet check  feels bigger than it is check  is technially bigger than some of the others in this class check check  best factory sound system ever check  very quick very responsive transmission especially with the paddle shifters check  thick meaty steering wheel great sporty seats check check  feature set is at least as good as the other ellpss check  torque vectoring reduces a lot the sensation of understeer check  decent gas mileage combined 26 hondaing to the center display check this thing is almost stingy with gas in fact check    and the list of positive attributes could go on and on    i do like driving the tl  very much  i dont regret getting it especially at 499mo plus tax and so far the dealer seems terrific lindsay acura columbus oh    however the sum of its parts pretty much equals er the sum of its parts audi and bmw and ill assume mercedes benz somehow seem to imbue their cars with something that makes them feel like more than the sum of their parts    its not that the tl seems flimsy or not stiff and firm  it does but there is something that is lacking  something that a new audi prestige sport or a new 335 bmw will have and you will notice instantly in some ways for the price the tl outdoes content wise both audi and bmw by a wide margin in other ways the tl seems like the best damn appliance electrolux ever made  take it away kelly ripa 34 payments to go   surprise    klikie klikie blush,markcincinnati

2982,October 2011,i dont know bose spends more on marketing than on the products    there is a saying no highs no lows must be bose    harmonkardon has a better reputation in sound quality but even they seem to skimp out for bmw installations    i think acura did the right thing in doing it themselves with no name tied to it but probably they did outsource to some company out there that remained nameless or they hunted and hired some key personnel from one of the soundspeaker companies  toy 16 audi tts audi awd commuter 17 volkswagen volkswagen alltrack se 4motion awd wifes 16 kia kia chrysler 16t fwd,andres3
2983,October 2011,i guess it depends i have a number of bose products and are very happy with them    we are talking about stock stereo systems based on the source i suspect there will be a lot of variability the only thing is acura can play dvda discs which imo is going the way of cassette it is debateable if there is a real world difference between a dvda disc at 96khz and a dvd disc at 48khz,kdshapiro
2984,October 2011,my wife has the bose upgrade in her 2011 infinity  it is very good but nothing so far comes close oem to what is in the acura the els system is the one i am speaking of    the bo was also very good  it must be the subwoofer in the acura since music feels so much more alive in the acura than either the audi or the infiniti    i agree dvdaudio good as it is is about as popular as divx i suspect that this is once again caused by good being the enemy of great    i do find this somewhat confusing since bluray seems to be a success and hdtv too seems to be the preferred way to watch tv these days    some of the dvdaudio disks are truly amazing  and very scarce    unfortunately i end up listening to siriusxm most of the time and it is truly poor it is so limited in dynamic range and frankly fidelity it is however better than most fm stations and being never out of signalrange is a big plus on those 100 mile commutes between cities i seem to make so often    i had hoped for more from satradio but i must admit i do like the station called deep tracks  and watercolors is pretty good too,markcincinnati
2985,October 2011,re acura els thats what im saying ive read a lot of heshe said on how good it is based on what audio source    have you tried playing a high qualify dvd with 51 in the thing its sounds amazing    i agree about xm however and this is a big however ill forgo the dynamic range to have the choice of music 40s on 4 60s on 6 70s on 7 watercolors soulrb whatever i listened to xm when i rented the g in the desert miles from anything loved it not to mention im loading up the harddrive with all sorts of stuff,kdshapiro
2986,October 2011,i guess it depends i have a number of bose products and are very happy with them    have you owned comparable products to the bose from other companies at similar price points    it is not debateable whether a regular dvd is as good in sound quality as a dvda it is not only the difference between 96 khz and 48 khz for the bandwidth but also 16bit vs 24bit96khz    ill take the pepsi challenge anyday with my home audio system and im positive the differences are noticeable and substantial i even have a 24bit48 khz that sounds noticeably better than regular dvds    however you are right sacd and dvda killed each other in a double suicide just like the fate of hddvd    bluray has sacddvda audio potential along with hd video capability to go with it so once cars get bluray players dvdaudio will be obsolete  toy 16 audi tts audi awd commuter 17 volkswagen volkswagen alltrack se 4motion awd wifes 16 kia kia chrysler 16t fwd,andres3

2995,October 2011,mark  i am guessing you have about twenty years on me i am seventies baby    if you have the internet on your smartphone all you need to do is go to the pandora site and create an account free with limited commercilas upgrades are available you create your own stations artist songs era etc etc  and just sync it to the bluetooth feature in the car its that simple i find it good for long trips with the kids they create their stations we hit the road and they enjoy the ride,billyperksii
2996,October 2011,i can stream pandora nobex iheartradio from my blackberry through my cars speakers but why i have much more variety on xm it sounds better and doesnt cost that much    if one is going to plunk down 40 for a tl or infiniti and pay expensive dealer maintenanceat least acura ill find out about infiniti first two services are free and put premium in the car then what is another 150year for an xm subscription makes no sense to me not to get it    but i guess to each their own,kdshapiro

2999,October 2011,i was with xm for several years then they came out with this royalty fees which i think was presumptuous for them to pass on to the customersthats why i left  i find streaming to be the future of radio listening who wants to pay to listen to the radio i know i dont considering the multiple free options available    secondly the streaming sound quality is above average through the acura speakers cannot attest to the bose,billyperksii

3001,November 2011,you didnt undestand the actual comments  1 putting money down on lease is defeating main lease advantage which is transfering depreciation risk to the finance company if car gets totalled the downpayment is gone gone gone whereas if you put nothing down gap included in lease will pick it up other advantages are businesses dont need to commit capital and get better tax treatment not really applicable for consumer thats why banks loooove people putting money down on lease and manufacturers advertise leases structured that way  they just picked up the tab and shows lower monthly payment on ads doesnt mean that one has to go for it  quite to contrary its generally bad idea period  2 people who put money down to lower payments on lease by definition demostrate that they do not undestand lease which means they should not lease lease is much more complex financing instrument with more variables that can be manipulated to create illusion of lower price there are cases when lease may be cheaper than financing  but not because of lower payment but because of hidden price break that is included in residual inflated above real predicted actual market value after return the manufacturers bank has to eat the price difference    one who decides to lease has to understand every single aspect of it otherwise they may be for very rude awakening at the end of the term when they owe 3 grand outright for mileage overrage and another two for scratches all of that has to be factored in thats why you read those comments from people saying that if one buys based on payment most likely they cant afford the car dont deserve it really is a simple rule of thumb  if you cant afford to buy it loancash you cant afford to lease it either there are some exceptions for very low mileage users or subsidized leases but just because monthly payment is lower it doenst mean its cheaper    i went through it with my recent purchase i got 328 wagon with a few options 45k msrp correctly structured lease 0 down 15kyr was about 200 per month less than 60 month loan with small 2500 downpayment yes  loan downpayments are making perfect sense as they lower overall financed amount and risk of being upside down in case of a total to me 200 per month is absolutely not enough especially that effective finance rate was higher on the lease than on the loan i made some quick math and it was evident that low interest loan was a better deal higher monthly payments but better deal overall now if somebody lives in monthly payment world they may not really understand the concept but thats a different discussion  2018 430i gran coupe,dino001
3002,November 2011,go to the infiniti dealer and ask to see the car that is advertise for that lease price changes are there isnt one around leader ad    we can agree to disagree you can put down 4k on a lease and waste your money to drive a car that you cant really afford ill use bmw money and put nothing down on a lease and use my 4k for my trip to germany when we do the european delivery of our 2012 bmw,flightnurse
3003,November 2011,thank you setting the record straight there is also another factor that goes into leasing is someone credit score if you have less then 720 mid score forget about getting the best rate on a lease these days it wont happen just like what you wrote those leader ads will be for 10k miles a year on a 3 yr lease how many people can drive that,flightnurse
3004,November 2011,leasing really was a great alternative 56 years ago and i used to do it but since then the car companies have gotten greedy and over value the residuals and make it impossible to get out of the leasing cycle once you start in it    for instance 56 years ago my leases used to have great residuals and buyouts so that if you really feel in love with the car and wanted to buy it you could without it breaking the bank some companies would even work with you to lower the buyout that is no more now the car companies inflate the residuals making the buyouts thousands of dollars over msrp and put disposition fees etc because they want you to return the car at the end of the lease and get something else from them thus never ending the cycle    i found this out the hard way and one of my vehicles is still on lease it is going to be my last lease as im switching back to financing,smarty666
3005,November 2011,you hit the nail on the head i just sit and laugh when i see the leasing commercials from the car manufactures say things like 3995 or 4295 due at signing that is just crazy,smarty666
3006,November 2011,with current economy you can always nego to do no money down  i just sign a lease with mbusa on 2012 c250 sport sedan with msrp439k on 24mo12k miyr i walked out 1k drive off incl 1st mo registration  2yr srvc plan and 400 per mo incl tax 875 of course every deal is different but dealer is making a lot of money on these fees,dl_amg
3007,November 2011,we can agree to disagree you can put down 4k on a lease and waste your money to drive a car that you cant really afford    whats up with you assuming to know what people can afford or not afford    the act of putting money down on a lease has absolutely no indication as to whether the person can afford it or not it may indicate that they either dont understand the advantages of not putting money down or they just want a little smaller monthly payment i dont think anyone should assume that just because they may prefer a smaller payment that they cant afford it its kind of like the old saying that people that cant afford to buy the car will lease it kind of like how you took affront when because of your screenname people assumed you were female    they could very well be much better off than you the one accusing them of not being able to afford one of these cars making blanket statements like that is silly and very condescending    complete understanding of the leasing process and concern about all the possible risks involved indicates one is more knowlegeablenot better off,m6user
3008,November 2011,again its a deal on the website from both bmw and infiniti    i never mentioned anything about downpayment or anything about lease specifics  so i dont know what we disagree about the only thing i stated was that infiniti has better posted lease prices then the bmw pointing to company listed current leases not blanket statement ,sweendogy
3009,November 2011,i looked back at your post at fist glance infiniti looks better than 328 even after rolling the downpayments into actual paments i looked at the websites and it appears that both have 10kyr so you can enjoy your car mostly in your garage not on the road however infiniti expects dealers to give up over 2 grand of markup  41k msrp less 27k due is 383k yet net cap cost including 700 acq fee is is 364k so about 25 grand comes out of the dealer bmw deal is structured around msrp which means there is additional dealer markup that can be negotiated from if you take out that 2 grand infiniti dealer contribution prices become similar in other words you walk into bmw and you can get your price down by a bit but at infiniti its probably close to bottom line    add paid maintenance dealer oil changes are over hundred bucks each add set of brake pads wipers perhaps some other things i think its a tie with 328 having slightly lower cost but infiniti being faster and perhaps better equipped  2018 430i gran coupe,dino001
3010,November 2011,i may not be the norm but in the first 3 years of ownership i went for oil changes wipers and tire rotations oil changes can be had for 40 bux sometimes less at the dealer rotations another 40 bux  and wipers are 20 bux a year now mind you i own the car not lease only one driver and i do not hammer it to redline at stop lights im sure many people have had tl go thru brakes during the same timeline but i think if you own a car and the maintience is not included you would baby it a little bit more knowing that infiniti would not fix it on the arm for larger ticket items the bmw progdodge sounds great but it does not cover those pricy run flats that are standard hit a couple of north eastern potholes and the slight cost advantage goes away lets not forget the lease return fee as well,sweendogy
3011,November 2011,fat chance on those 40 there is no doubt bmw can get expensive at times i dont kow prices at infininti dealers but all other lux cars incl lexus or mercedes benz oil changes are easy north of 100 its both the special grade synthetic oil and labor so i find it unlikely infiniti would charge much less 40 are those mineral oil changes at chevrolet ford or toyota not synthetic a six pack of synthetic mobil 1 is almost 40 at costco and it may not be appropriate for your particular car to balance bmw has oil changes every 1015k miles depending on actual driving which can balance several 40 per 3k miles changes    btw infiniti has lease return fees directly from infiniti website disposition fee due at termination of lease all lease companies do no exceptions they may sometimes waive them if you get another car of same brand    i get it you like infiniti fine there is a lot to like just dont oversell it it is not really as inexpensive as you would like to make us believe still 40 grand  2018 430i gran coupe,dino001
3012,November 2011,dino  im not selling anything i started this trying to clairify costs that were posted by another who said bmw was had a clear advantage in leasing clearly you dont totally get it do i think the infiniti is a better car for my 40k vs a 328 sure is it better them the 335  nope but power and price are something i value for sure  maintenance for a car is great but lets not get blinded by the fact that bmw does this for a reason they want you to lease and this service helps them resell the car when it comes bac for a premium as certified its a fantastic model of how to sell cars and caddy has followed this lead  oil changes  well hyundai link 40 bux  no that fat now you know    httpherbchambersinfinitiofwestboroughcomserviceandpartsspecials,sweendogy
3013,November 2011,i hyundaied and i was right this is mineral oil change synthetic extra which means you have threefour of those per one on bmw so it is 100120 for same period of comparison this also means twothree more visits at the place twothree more opportunities to sell you more than just oil change    again infiniti is a good car all im saying it is probably not as cheap as you want to believe and i know you are not selling  well perhaps just your beliefs  all im doing is to clarify your clarifications trying to level the comparisons to same benchmarks manufacturers are great when it comes to muddy the comparisons to their advantage doesnt mean we have to believe everything they say    again  1 infiniti offer is good but it already requires dealers participation in discount about 2500 lower bmw price by that amount and then recalculate lease to get the offer comparison leveled  2 both have disposal fee  3 bmw pays all but tires and wheel alignment which is strange maintenance infiniti does not just periodic inspections based on your link will sum up to a few hundreds over the lease period add oil changes and some rubber and other fluids and you may go over 1000 bucks easy  4 infiniti has better features and power bmw has better resale if you want comparable bmw 335 would cost you more no doubt    altogether bmw may come a bit cheaper total cost but probably not by much in my town bmw dealers are far superior to infiniti in customer service and sale experience  2018 430i gran coupe,dino001
3014,November 2011,yeah im going to have to call bs on those infiniti service pricing as i never was quoted any where near that from my local infiniti dealers for oil and filer and tire rotations those two always ended up over 100 bucks hence why i went somewhere else to have that done,smarty666
3015,November 2011,you can call it what you want but again a smart shopper knowing dealers have websites and competitors will shop around and get better look at the link i posted dino sure its not synthetic but the 1015k time period between changes seems a pretty long time between dealer visits for a 40k car i guess if its a lease who cares right     smarty you had an infiniti werent you the same guy talking up the tl as well  i think the with the 10 plus thou i saved not getting the 335 i can afford 3 dealer trips a year for oil,sweendogy
3016,November 2011,with bmw the car tells you when to go and change the oil has nothing to do with the lease 1015k is quite normal for regular use btw it is very common in europe  there nobody uses mineral oil even on lowend subcompacts but they do have much longer service periods it really is just us where 3k is still prevailing attitude at service stations in turn they put mineral oil even into engines that should never see it  2018 430i gran coupe,dino001
3017,November 2011,dino its not worth it sweeny is right we are all wrong go back and read other postings of his and you will see a trend    if infiniti was the better car then bmw wouldnt be in business however when it comes to leasing no one wins but the banks    just a fyi bmw and infiniti audi lexus mb all drop the return fee if you lease another one of their cars but bmw is the only one who will do it without asking my first bmw i leased was a 325is and when i bought my 330i the fee was dropped and i never said a word,flightnurse

3020,November 2011,pretty close to what i was paying for my pontiac5 oil changes as well i sure dont recall ever thinking man these oil changes are killing me my volkswagen volkswagen oil changes were more expensive due to the filter we have one vehicle that requires 90 oil changes but it wasnt the infiniti    i will say that some of the maintenance items were pretty high but i suspect theyre in line with other vehicles in this class then again i put 108000 miles on it without a single repair just maintenance so overall it was a darn economical vehicle  moderator    need help navigating kirstiehedmundscom  or send a private message by hyundaiing on my name    share your vehicle reviews,Kirstie_H

3041,December 2011,i still rather have na straight 6 perhaps if when gas goes to 56 buck a gallon ill change my mind    i basically decided to jump in and get one before new 328 exactly because of the four cylinder replacing base six in 328 got the wagon so no bmw on that plus 50k after some options still too much for me boy what a sweet machine  drove it in germany on autobahn got to 138 mph before traffic stopped me now waiting for delivery in spartanburg  probably in january    dont care about lower gas mileage dont care about lower weight higher powertorque i just wanted that na straight six  its probably one of the best engines in the history and i bet bmw would never have changed if not for the new cafe    i had enough four cylinder turbos  2002 subaru and 2008 subaru sti which are boxers inherently better configurations that straight four fast great handling in some aspects may better than 328 allows faster corner entry and maintains that speed throughout still  i just wanted more adult car than my sti was ready to give up some power and even some handling    to me bmw 3series was always about two things weight distribution 5050 and straight six the 328 i just bought had interior that is just ok but it looks like it was designed thirty minutes before the car was to be released  give some nice leather and wood inlays add dashboard from 1989 and youre done the car overcomes that in those mechanical aspects but take of of them away and other choices become very compelling    audis are so much better lookingby a mile both inside and out have better equipment cheaper or being a little on frugal side i may get even lower to acura not sure about that but would give it a try or even volvo v50    to me bmw voluntarily gave up something they had over their competition they better make it up in other areas  or else  2018 430i gran coupe,dino001
3042,December 2011,not all engines are created equal though you cant condemn all 4cyl turbos based on your subaru experience the turbo boxer 4 is actually quite coarse compared to say the 2 liter volkswagen turbo that same 2 liter is also smoother and much more flexible than volvos i5 turbo so you should really withold judgegment until you try it  17 ford crew 27 67 coronet rt 14 towncountry limited 09 lsubaru hse 44car history and counting,qbrozen
3043,December 2011,thats not what i meant actually subaru boxers are great exhaust note is almost as intoxicating as that on the bmw six but i have not met i4 that i was impressed with to me they all sound like sewing machines they may be quiter some or more powerful than those from subaru not many esp sti but it usually comes with high cost counterweight balance shafts boxer is naturally balanced just like straight six and offers low cg no id rather have the h4 or even i5 before i would get i4    but more important  i got i6 which is what all i wanted for now shades  2018 430i gran coupe,dino001
3044,December 2011,heh    he tries to talk them out of them and explains that the mileage restrictions will kill them at the end of lease but people do not listen to them at all    something about the customers not listening to the voice of reason by the salesman makes me laugh,ivan_99

3047,December 2011,a major news network is seeking to interview someone who was saved from serious injurydeath in an auto accident due to new safety technology the ideal candidate should live in close proximity to a major metropolitan area ie los angeles chicago new york city etc please send an email to predmundscom by 3 pmpt december 8  moderator    need help navigating kirstiehedmundscom  or send a private message by hyundaiing on my name    share your vehicle reviews,Kirstie_H
3048,December 2011,hes right i did changed it since edmunds gives the option to change i used it to chamge it but obviously you didnt get what i was saying  v6 audi i 6 who cares it was 6 as being the point  and the fact that the class leader was changing its standard engine to a 4 act as if,sweendogy
3049,December 2011,hondaing to the webzine winding road their review of the new i4 turbo makes me feel that one would not feel slighted having a bmw with this motor quite the contrary their comments about the new larger 3 series also encouraging,markcincinnati
3050,December 2011,agreed all else being equal id opt for a normally aspirated i6 over a blown i4 however all else aint even close to being equal specifically   the i4 turbo has more maximum power and torque and a substantially widerflatter power band   the i4 turbo weighs significantly less than the i6 which will aid in handling and fuel economy   the i4 turbo is shorter albeit wider by virtue of the turbo and its requisite plumbing than the i6 and as such is easier to package which should in turn make service easier   the i4 turbo returns significantly better fuel economy    this is not to discount the fact that i6 motors are naturally balanced and have virtually no torque renissanl events of which there are two for every rotation of a 4cylinder4stroke engine and as such are naturally smoother both in operation and in power delivery that said the portion of the roughness of an i4 which is attributable to the engines natural imbalance is a relatively minor due to its 20 liter displacement the threshold beyond which balance shafts become increasingly necessary and are easily cancelled via a relatively smalllight weight set of balance shafts    long story short take a drive in a late model volkswagen or audi or audi or audi 20t and try and find something objectionable about the power delivery visàvis a late model bmw ive now had two i6 bmw the engine in my wifes new volkswagen is easily on par with the unit installed in both of my mounts from munich,shipo
3051,December 2011,mileage i havent heard yet from anyone who has a new bmw or z4 but in theory it should get better mileage however its a realitive thing if you are always in the boost then mileage is going to suck,flightnurse
3052,December 2011,shipo this is encouraging to hear but when your friends say high 30s they cant mean 37 or 38 on highway if true this would throw a big wrench in both the hybrid world and thier own diesel 3 series btw i think the 3 series bmw is a true wolf in sheep clothing drove one and loved it however the price tag to enter i couldnt justify,flightnurse
3053,December 2011,why is it easy to pile miles on in az say austin or tampa since i live in phoenix i hardly drive many miles im usually in another city working however when i was working in phoenix i didnt but more miles then when i lived in san diego,flightnurse
3054,December 2011,the highway mpg number that ive heard bandied about is just what you suggested 37 to 38 that said i dont think it will be much of a showstopper for the new 320d either version because while the numbers are harder to squeeze out of those in the know very high forties or low fifties are what im led to believe,shipo
3055,December 2011,hondaing to info posted about the new z4 sdrive 28i on wwwfueleconomygov its estimated to get 33mpg hwy with the new 8 speed transmission    while i would never say never i dont see how a larger car will use the same or very similar running gear and do better than the z4 i cant see the high 30s at best the very low 30s which is still nothing to whine about imo,busiris
3056,December 2011,when i go there i normally put 50to 100 miles a day on my car if i worked in phoenix i would commute 80 miles rt to me thats piling on the miles,kdshapiro
3057,December 2011,the numbers ive been quoted are for rwd and manual transmission equipped f30 bmw models in the case of the z4 this configuration yields 34 mpg on the highway that said my understanding is that while the engine in the 2012 z4 is the same basic engine the unit which will find its way into the f30 has a few changes as i understand things the new engine should deliver slightly more power and better fuel economy    time will tell,shipo
3058,December 2011,with the added power better mpgs and it being a little bit lighter  question will be why would anyone buy a 335  performance wise they are very similar reading car and driver they can both be set with the m package plus mpgs in the mid 30s highway  wont be long before bmw bumps the hp on the 335 i would guess,sweendogy

3064,December 2011,i did not create the topic  it was started by another  the great acura debate  now please rebut why the acura should be here also add what the brand has improved on and where its going i have commented on both and it would be nice to get the other side thats unbiased    billy i have not stated anything that cant be backed up  reviews and sales numbers tell the story im sorry you feel like the colts of the nfl manning is hurt maybe one day he will return to bring the team back to some relevant level,sweendogy
3065,December 2011,who has the acura you sweendogy or billy who has what in other words    so sweendogy wants billy to rebut refute why the acura should be discussed in this forum is that correct does this mean that sweendogy wants the acura to remain as one of the cars discussed here or not    isnt it true that the acura is on this forum and no matter what we say it will stay    im so confused confuse,markcincinnati
3066,December 2011,sween has an infiniti infinitix  he previously owned a 1st generation acura that he thought was an exceptional car hes part of the antiacura faction here on our lovely board    i actually own a 2010 acura w technology pkg 4 cyl  2001 prelude type sh 2015 infiniti q40 awd 2017 honda honda touring awd,nyccarguy
3067,December 2011,actually i owned an 2000 acura gsr  close on the acura but went 2003 volkswagen gli instead then 08 infiniti pontiac5x and no i have never driven a newer acura first generation acura was a great car and i enjoyed the test drive i was real close on it but went with the gli because it was a both were 6 speed was a tad quicker and won a head to head in some mag also had a vr6 eng and was 5k cheaper service between acura and volkswagen not close and reliability of the gli was no where near what i experianced with the gsr,sweendogy
3068,December 2011,personally i dont care if the acura is here yes or no i am not intrested in the car so i abstain myself from those post  as to what you call advancement in terms of the g i see it as just another model year change  1 more horsepower wow thats really advanced  2 added coupe wow technological breakthrough i guess 1st in the industry  3seven speed transmission thats giving a whole lot of troublesee the infiniti boards why not eighti thought they were advanced  4 sport package bigger wheels and front faciathats some sport  currently infiniti has nothing that would warrant a visit from me their showroom thats just my opinion,billyperksii
3069,December 2011,my bad almost everything will seem bloated compared to an acura gsr whatd that weigh 2600 lbs soaking wet with rocks in its pocket    so your g is a pontiac5x gotcha youre happy with it i assume have you driven a infinitix with the bigger 37  5 speed automatic how do they compare  2001 prelude type sh 2015 infiniti q40 awd 2017 honda honda touring awd,nyccarguy

3072,December 2011,your opinion is fine and i guess you are not the target audience for the carreviewers and sales numbers support the public likes what they are doing    1 yep hp is something that advances if mpg stay the same or get better  check  2 coupe  yep thats something that others have  convertables as well but some car companies do not play in these areas they have a hard top convert as wel  3transmissions  car companies do have issues with them for sure remember the 03 tl and others  4 more then you write is included including paddles  they also offered rear wheel steering on earlier models  5 you forgot to mention the sports line they released sure its on a small number of cars but its something    currently you are one of a few who dont see the hybrid technology the performance and the value in the brand,sweendogy
3073,December 2011,ya know i feel the same about the tl nothing to draw me into showroom no disrepect for any tl owners    the g does have sedan coupe convertible and ipl yes the seven speed is reported to give some trouble i dont have trouble with mine if i remember honda went through a set of issues of its own related to the tranny    the m model has hybrid solution hope it trickles down to the g,kdshapiro
3074,December 2011,currently you are one of a few who dont see the hybrid technology the performance and the value in the brand  no i dont sorry  please let us know the appreciating value in owning a pontiac5 or any infinit product or just plain simple any brand of car,billyperksii
3075,December 2011,the m model has hybrid solution hope it trickles down to the g  so does this the honda and the honda,billyperksii
3076,December 2011,after 11 months with an infiniti product i have become a believer that they are producing cars that do warrant consideration especially if your other choice is a bmw of course this great recession may be partially the cause of my conversion despite the fact that i find the g too small narrow i believe it to be a bargain when compared to a 3 series max one of the infinitixs out and it is perhaps 45k content the 3 as close as possible to the g and the price will be a lot higher    bmw are breathtakingly expensive to repair and sometimes even maintain after the 50000 mile bmw bubble expires the infiniti we own  infiniti  seems to be pretty inexpensive to maintain and the 7 speed transmission has been trouble free and we are now at about 18k miles    everyone here is certainly entitled to not find anything attractive about a given brand or model within the brand  and that is fine however if you have not recently taken an infiniti or any other car listed here on the masthead out for a long testdrive it seems unlikely that you can make a factual statement about the brand or specific model    i know for instance that i have not driven a lexus  my opinion is that they are sofas on wheels  but that is only based on car magazine comments that i have read i probably have my head up my nose in thinking that they are not performance cars i plan to not opine any further on the brand since i know very little about them    i really dont care if anyone test drives an infiniti or an acura  i do care somewhat if a specific model is criticized but never driven i participate in these boards to learn and to share experiences and opinions    i do enjoy being buicked by owners or even car mavens who have tested so many cars it almost seems a career stories about their experiences    keep em coming    and  drive it like you live    shades,markcincinnati

3079,December 2011,there are some cases where serendipity happens and being an opinionated poseur is being 100 correct    lexus  at least some models are sofas on wheels i took an lexus on two extended test drives there obviously is a market for them as there are quite a few on the road they are nice cars beautifully crafted reliabile and a ton of tech    i however wanted more toward sporty aspirations tl was too big turning radius too big not convinced of the value of shawd infiniti has neck snapping acceleration and fit me like a glove i didnt even want to look at the tl 2012    as you aptly put it outfit a 335 like a infiniti and you are at 50 large    to each their own everybody has their own priorities of what they want andor dislike in a vehicle,kdshapiro
3080,December 2011,ok guys weve been doing a lot of bickering disagreeing on the board lately lets try something different if youve got any kind of driving experience whether via test drive or ownership with one of the ellps cars share with the group ill go first go to the bathroom  set your dvr this is going to be a decent sized post    acura acura as you all know i own a 2010 acura acura with technology package its the 24 l 4 cylinder mated to a 5  speed automatic transmission i originally bought the car for my wife when we had 2 kids and were 2 years into leasing a 2007 bmw x3 after 2 years we already had 38000 miles on it and were only alloted 45000 for 3 years on the last day of cash for clunkers i bought the acura using a 3500 credit    i think the acura is handsome not head turning gorgeous like a 911 turbo or 458 italia i definitely dont think its ugly    i like the enginetransmission combination the engine winds all the way up to 7000 rpm very smoothly transmission shifts are crisp the transmission will hold a gear and not upshift at the redline i love the thickly bolstered seats  the well crafted interior it rides fantastic comfortable yet far from isolated handling for a fwd car is very good    my main gripes with the car are its lifeless electric power steering and its crummy straight from an honda brakes    infiniti infinitix my uncle had one and he let me drive it i took it on a really nice 45 minute drive i came away extremely impressed with this car kdshapiro hit the nail right on the head when he said infiniti has neck snapping acceleration and fit me like a glove this cars 326 horsepower make it a bona fide road rocket handling is truly amazing excellent balance i got in the car and found pefect seating right away after 5 minutes it felt like it was mine the car feels like it is turning on an axis if it had gotten an epa estimated 2 mpg more id have one sitting in my drivewy right now it didnt qualify for the 3500 c4c rebate though    lexus is 350 i drove one at a lexus event when this body style came out in 2006 i happen to like the cars styling the interior was well crafted and well thought out acceleration was blazingly quick i thought the suspension was too isolated the brakes were instant on and had no pedal feel to them at all the back seat was tiny too this coming from a guy who drives a prelude    bmw e90 3 series i have extensively driven an e90 328xia  e90 335xia the 328xia was my moms car that she leased for 3 years even the heaviest e90 sedan awd  automatic with the 240 hp na i6 is a blast to drive handling was unbelieveable the engine is so smooth brakes are fantastic very progressive and linear im madly in love with this car it is everything people rave about and more    i had a 335xia as a loaner a few times its torque is seductive pulls like a small v8 rather than a turbo 6 amazing car    my biggest gripes with the 3 series is its cdodgeped back seat small trunk and hefty price i know it is a bmw and you get what you pay for flightnurse you happened to find a perfect drivers car sitting on a lot and got a helluva deal on it my moms was an 08 328xia with premium cold weather automatic metallic paint parking sensors  manual sunshades no sport nav or comfort access it stickered for over 46000 it is very easy for a 335 to get in the 50k range    questions comments  2001 prelude type sh 2015 infiniti q40 awd 2017 honda honda touring awd,nyccarguy
3081,December 2011,mark i dont just blabber about a car and read some article in a magazine i actually test drove the pontiac5x for an extensive time the salesperson actually gave me the keys and said have fun but be careful  i wanted to try another brand because my previous car was the 2003 tl type s the g just did not do it for me i tried to force myself to like it but i just knew it would have been buyers remorse  here are the deal breakers and i have said this many a times  1too cdodgep mazda millennia interior size  2 intrusive growl could get annoying a long road trips  3 i just felt beat up after the test drive    i have nothing against the brand maybe the next generation g will sway me but from what i seen with the new styling cues on the m g coupe and fxi think i will step on my accelerator when i go by an infiniti dealership,billyperksii
3082,December 2011,finally some substance i agree the g could be a little cdodgeped when compared to a tl or buick infact there have been complaints from bigger drivers that the cars seats are a problem the growl is something that older folks have also complained about the coupe does have a very intense growl when pushed in the city the 07 and 08s sedans for sure also make sounds  this is something that can be heard when screeching from red light to red light bit not at 70mph on the highway the newer infiniti sedan has toned down the rear sound to make it more of a chrysler and to accommodate the older folks who complained as i type im getting ready for an 800 mile was coast tour which im dreading because we are not taking my g we have to take my wifes honda because its roomier the g is not a problem at all on long trips i mean its not a 89 covrvette  its a great highway chrysler when asked    styling is subjective so cant argue,sweendogy
3083,December 2011,the original lexus was a great 1st entry into this segment razor sharp handling  excellent brakes its 215 horsepower i6 was outgunned by the bmw e46 bmw and then by the 330i and it got not so great fuel economy and this is when gas was cheap lexus owners complained about the rough ride lexus brought the car in to compete with bmw e36 but the e46 was already on its way by the time the lexus hit our shores they brought brass knuckles to a gun fight    they brought the 300 hp is 350 automatic only toyota corporate v6 060 in the mid 5s instead of the low 7s brakes that provided excellent stopping distance but with not much pedal feel lexus was very high on their 300 hp number vs 255 in bmw recently released e90 330i    i drove the lexus lexus back to back with a 330i at their event the lexus out accelerated the bmw but just felt very artificial compared to the very athletic bmw    the lexus had no power    the problem with the lexus was that only a year after its release was sent packing by bmw n54 twin turbo 300 hp i6    i think lexus is waiting to see the next 3 series to finalize the next is they might just hit one out this time  2001 prelude type sh 2015 infiniti q40 awd 2017 honda honda touring awd,nyccarguy

3087,December 2011,i wanted to try another brand because my previous car was the 2003 tl type s the g just did not do it for me i tried to force myself to like it but i just knew it would have been buyers remorse    when i was looking for a new 2005 ellps i looked at the pontiac5 along with the tl the pontiac5 was noticeably a bit narrow but not a show stopper for me i actually like a bit smaller cars i thought the tls interior was nicer i drove the pontiac5 and noticed the major power along with a major growl i didnt like the lack of refinement the tl was smooth and quiet    i then drove the pontiac5 on a transition dodgep between two freeways that you can take at about 55mph there is a perpendicular concrete seam with a bit of elevation difference on this dodgep so going over it the car jolts a bit and it is on a fast curve on the tl the car was steady over the bump on the pontiac5 the steering wheel jerked pretty hard and i really had to be holding it tight or it would have jerked out of my hand not so on the tl based upon that experience the tl won i just turned 115k on my tl today and ive only had to replace a window actuator along with normal maintenance and an outside air temp gauge recall no other mechanical issues,tlong

3095,January 2012,mb and bmw are more expensive for comparable equipment one could carefuly option those to get somewhat close to g or tl as long as they can let go some of those luxuries    however one of my biggest complaints is 3seres and cseries having folddown seat optional except 328 wagon there is really no excuse for that  12k kia and hyundai have it standard  there is no excuse its all about hitting some arbitrary limit for advertising starting at bs i know i have 328  fortunately its a wagon so it has folding seats and sunroof standard but sedan does not what makes it worse i see dealers actually ordering those without folding seats in large numbers i can only imagine a brand new owner of 50k 335 trying to fold hisher seats and discovering the car doesnt have it sick lemon    on many other options im more agnostic  there are merrits to both approaches bundling and not bundling i tend to want almost everything but experimental stuff like adaptive cruise control or variable speed steering but bundling sports package with nav is a little too much even if i would order both anyway to me its ok to bundle related items in package like all convenience all tech or all sports but crossbundling does sound a little like making a run on customers wallet even if some customers would take them both    for valueoriented people probably nothing beats acura  you get everything except navtechnology i like it but it does have its limits  front wheel drive base version is one and that ugly nose lemon we still dont have it so bad here  you would have to see a price sheet on bmw in europe  its actually a book proverbial mirrors and steering wheel are optional of course they also have three times as many engine versions which creates many more permutations but thats a different story entirely not to mention everything costs nearly twice as much literally  50k 335 would likely cost you almost 100 grand there  2018 430i gran coupe,dino001
3096,January 2012,fwiw i dont have a personal stake or emotions tied to this discussion because i dont own any of the cars in this segment also i can research and maybe eventually purchase a boring volkswagen or subaru subaru for my wife without craving more excitement because i already own an honest sports car that gives me more driving and ownership pleasure than any car in this segment ever could    mb c350 standard features missing on the infiniti dodge    sport suspension with electronic control adaptive dampers  adaptive brakes with predictive brake priming auto brake drying and hill start assist  14 way power driver seat with power lumbar adjust  power steering column  driver memory with settings for seat mirrors and steering column  auto dim rearview and driver outside mirror  moonroof  wood trim hyundai  rain sensing automatic wipers  splitfold rear seats  harman kardan logic 7 450 watt audio  9 airbags including pelvis and knee airbags  attention assist to detect driver drowsiness    infiniti dodge standard features missing on the c350    xenon headlamps  leather seats  keyless start  free metallic paint    please let me know if ive missed anything    so my assertion that the infiniti lacks quite a few features seems to be valid but more importantly did you notice that most of the c350 features are performance or safety related while the infiniti features are basically fluff but to even things up as accurately as possible lets load them both up as closely as we can    so a c350 with added xenon headlamps leather seats navigation metallic paint 18 wheels and keyless start costs 46440    now a infiniti dodge with wood trim premium package navigation package and sport package costs 45045    it looks like the mercedes benz is 1400 more expensive than the infiniti    but the infiniti still lacks electronic adaptive suspension adaptive brakes and attention assist also missing are headlights with adaptive highbeams curve assist and headlamp washers splitfold rear seats knee and pelvis airbags and rainsensing wipers    the c350 lacks dvd playback zagat restsaturnnt guide aluminum pedals magnesium shift paddles and a viscous limited slip    draw your own conclusions  im exhausted sick,fedlawman
3097,January 2012,i discovered an error in my research im not sure what i did but the above described c350 actually costs 48190 not 46440 edit the 1750 leather seats didnt get added in    i also just noticed that when i added the wood trim to the infiniti it automatically added the 1200 technology package which includes rainsensing wipers and precrash seatbelts since these are standard features on the c350 this doesnt change the math in my previous post    the increase in the price of the c350 raises the gap between the merc and infiniti up to about 3150    however something else occurred to me    take the well equipped c350 described above and remove the metallic paint 720 18 wheels 1040 and leather interior 1750  options which affect appearance only barely if at all and have no effect on performance comfort safety or functionality    the same c350 now costs 44680  a savings of 3500    now do the same thing with the above described infiniti and remove the wood trimoh wait the technology package requires the wood trim ok lets remove the 18 wheelsnope theyre part of the sport package that includes the upgraded suspension leather seats are standard so thats not an option ok i hate to lose it but what about the moonroof sorry its part of the premium package which includes driver memory settings and bose premium audio    the c350 now costs 350 less than the infiniti bundles  mad,fedlawman

3109,January 2012,some reviews have said that the my 2006 35 was smoother than the current 37  that the bore and stroke job added a few horsies but apparently increased the harshness    also notice that the peak tq rating for the current vq is only 9 higher than the my 2006 car and occurs 400 rpm higher peak hp is up 30 but it arrives 700 rpm higher    robbing from peter to pay paul is a tuning trick the manufacturers use to raise the hp on paper the rated hp is higher now but a sacrifice in midrange grunt is the tradeoff,fedlawman

3115,January 2012,this is the game one plays when comparing a german manufacturer vs a japanese manufacturer    one can either see what a given price point gives or option the vehicles as nearly as identically as possible and see the price difference    the 350 is a classier car but the infiniti is definitely the value leader not giving up anything in performance to any other car in this segment there has been a lot of discussion on the nvh at wot of the infiniti i could care less as long as the thing goes when i step on the gas the enthusiasts will nit pick everything    different strokes for different folk i do like the 350 and maybe will look at that as my next car,kdshapiro
3116,January 2012,i agree with you completely kd thats why i said the other day that its not a fight with a winner and loser but a circular discussion with no end    i really like the infiniti too and agree that in dodge trim its the performance value leader of this segment personally though if i was shopping in this segment i would want my sporty car to have an equal measure of luxury    the european cars have the secret formula stylish and luxurious cabins smooth powerful drivetrains and sublime ride and handling infiniti is close but not quite there,fedlawman

3124,January 2012,i have lamented the lack of manual transmissions in these ellps and lps cars for years  my last manual was virtually the last manual that i could get in a car that i really wanted and that was in a 2003 audi allroad with the 27t engine    then i bought a 2005 audi audi with the 6speed tiptronic followed by a 2009 audi 20t prestige with the sport package also with the 6speed tip we have an 11 infiniti with the 7speed auto trans and i have test driven several 2012s that have 8speeds all german cars of course frankly my experience with a modern welldone 67 or 8 speed auto pretty much means i dont care too much if i never again have to row my own the current crop of automatics really is that good surprise    the point is finally the reason for the paucity of manual transmissions offered to us mericans is  us    even when manuals are offered few dealers stock them and if you find one on a dealers lot it will probably be a strippie because the dealer knows any manual transmission car will sit and sit and sit and sit on the lot or showroom floor an unlikely place to find one the dealer has to finance the stick shift car just like any other and then ultimately discount the car so much that repeating the process becomes about as far away from the dealers mind as the nearest star other than our sun    some of the cars can be ordered with stick shifts but again we mericans want to cruise in on saturday test drive the car buy it if we like it and take it home the same day gotta have it gotta have it    moreover getting a bunch of folks to hyundai up money or even letters of intent to a manufacturer to buy en masse stick shift cars hardly ever works quick story my friend used to own an audiporsche store in cincinnati he said aoa accepted a petition you cannot petition the lord with prayer to import audis with manual transmissions this was a few years back  well aoa was still in recovery mode from the 80s unintended acceleration fiasco and sonofagun if aoa didnt begin offering audis with 6speed sticks    no one bought them ok virtually no one bought them    the dealers and aoa probably felt like those cartoon characters who when fooled turn into a giant tootsiepop    the acura tl awd is offered with one of the sweetest and smoothest sticks in the biz  maybe 3 of tls are special ordered with a stick maybe    the audi audi i better check can still be had with a 6speed stick but the 8speed tip is a sweetie  i wouldnt bother with the 6speed manual anymore especially if i had to worry about resale    sure there are rabid foaming at the mouth stickshift die hards who will pay a premium for a used car with a stick shift and maybe even willing to do so for a new one but there arent many of them so ones ability to sell the car when one wants to or when the dealer wants to  meaning in the same year as they acquired it for instance is very uncertain compared to the same car with the auto    how about this lets see if we can get 500 people to send in deposits to  which car maker and for which model no way we could get 500 folks to agree to order the same car  no way would that many people want a pick one    i doubt we could even get 50 of us to pool our votes read money to make it worth any manufacturers while to let us buy one of their manual transmission versions of the xyz model that they sell in other markets but not here    not gonna happen again you cannot petition the lord with prayer    i say qwiturbitchin at least here  virtually all ellps and probably literally all lps cars only are offered with automatics and pretty soon ill wager only autos will be offered due to any real marketplace interest in stick shifts    folks that will actually buy stick shifts are about as hard to find from the manufacturers perspective as living survivors of the civil war    there im over them stick shifts not civil war survivors too    drive it like you live    you cannot petition the lord with prayer quote  the doors from the album the soft parade,markcincinnati
3125,January 2012,even though i accept todays automatics as excellent pieces of tech  i must admit that i do still enjoy manual transmissions    having said that i still believe manuals will soon pretty much disappear from the automotive landscape    on the other hand you gotta admire somewhat buick for bringing out a couple of new cars these past 1224 months that offer sticks of course the dealers say they are novelties not really someting that has much of a market    mores the pity,markcincinnati

3134,January 2012,because of the economic meltdown car prices have stayed pretty stable since 08 yet features and performance have continued to climb new my2012 cars like the audi 5series and cclass got major revisions without rising significantly in price    however i think the biggest difference in value is in the compact car segment where quality and features have skyrocketed in the past few years cars like the ford and chevrolet offer economy performance refinement and luxury unheard of in their segment back in 2008,fedlawman
3135,January 2012,i agree with your last paragraph were entering a period where less is more insofar as our choices in autos goes    it used to be only bigger is better and that only the big cars got the more is more treatment    i had or my wife had better said three audi tts the last two were the high performance models at the time with the 225hp 4 cylinder 18    due to a timing issue i had the distinct pleasure not really of having her last tt as my daily driver for a month or so    god i felt like a bug when i drove it on i71 in rush hour a big semi with trailer would damn near blow me away  or so it felt    now the car was nimble and very peppy and all that  but damn get me the hell outta here this was my daily mantra    when i then got my 2005 audi i felt much better  then when my 2009 audi came in with a 110 wheelbase and a wide stance i felt better still    currently in our garage is an 11 infiniti infiniti awd and a 12 acura tl awd  i have grown to like and pretty much can say now after many months have passed that i love driving either one of them    as big as the acura is it is amazing to me that it only has a 109 wheelbase yet it feels bigger still than my previous audi less is more indeed    cant wait to come up with some excuse to test the new 3 series  but i will of course await the bmw model as i simply wouldnt even consider 2wd period    best time ever to be in the market  yup    drive it like you live shades,markcincinnati
3136,January 2012,sweeny the only 5 series not to come with a manual is bmw the bmw will be coming with a manual im only guess that the bmw doesnt have one because its an entry level 5 series and people wouldnt want one in it which is sad since it would be a great car with one,flightnurse
3137,January 2012,ray the new bmw does not come with a manual as of yet however it is in the works the other 5 series to have a manual is the 550i since bmw has revamped the 550i to really be a watered down bmw the 550i is on my very short list of cars,flightnurse
3138,January 2012,excellent post and yes the compact car segment has gotten better i mean leather interior bluetooth smooth ride and quality interior but it comes with a price a fully loaded chevrolet is 26k the new buick verano fully loaded is 30k so get these these goodies costs too,flightnurse
3139,January 2012,the only thing the 6 has over the 4 is the smoothness of the engine and for some people that means a lot there is no 4 cyl that will be as smooth as the bmw inline 6,flightnurse
3140,January 2012,we will see flight if the is the case i dont think bmw would put a crappy engine in a 5 talk smooth all you want but mpgs and acceleration is what brings people gets people hot,sweendogy
3141,January 2012,smoothness comes in two flavors the first is engine balance and the second is power delivery    engine balance   the only match i know of for an i6 in this metric is an h4 an h6 or a v12 pretty much every other engine configuration suitable for an automobile will develop ordered vibrations at some level    power delivery   engines of the 4stroke  4cylinder or fewer variety suffer from noticeable torque renissanl events in the case of the four pot motor there are two such events per revolution of the crank what is a torque renissanl event a state where the power delivery of the last cylinder to fire has waned to the point where it can no longer sustain engine rotation and when the next cylinder to fire has yet to wax to the point where it can sustain said rotation considering 4stroke engines apply over 90 of their power between a point twenty degrees after tdc and twenty degrees before bdc there are two forty degree periods per rotation of the crank where the engine mechanicals and the flywheel are driving the engine    remediation   the remediation of natural engine imbalance of i4 engines has been known for a very long time simply keep displacement to roughly two liters or less and apply two imbalance shafts rotating at twice engine rpm one to either side of the block and the natural vibrations of the engine are effectively cancelled out     the remediation of torque renissanl events is both easier and not as complete it is easier because the manufacturer only needs to add a heavier flywheel to effectively dampen out the events the thing is dampening isnt as complete for lack of a better word as cancelling the torque renissanls will always be there it will just be very difficult to sense them    final thoughts  all intermittent combustion engines exhibit torque peaks and valleys even the monster 18 cylinder subaru800 double wasp and the even monsterer 28cylinder r4360 wasp major that said once beyond the 6cylinder threshold the valleys dont step into the realm of negative torque and are thus imbued with a property called smoothness six cylinder engines even bmw vaunted i6 models do venture briefly into the negative torque territory three times per revolution but the excursion below the line of zero torque is so shallow and so short in duration they too have been given accolades for their smoothness    for my part if bmw newish turbocharged 20 liter i4 is engineered to be only as smooth as the 20t in our new volkswagen it will be more than smooth enough for me,shipo
3142,January 2012,great post  i nominate it for one of the great posts awards as if there is such an award    if the new bmw turbo 4 is as smooth as the 4 that was in my 2009 audi i would be delighted knowing how time and tide tend to mean incremental improvements are possible because of the passage of time  plus a stack of 100 bills i would assume this new bmw engine will be even smoother love the higher hp and slightly higher torque than in the audi 20t  makes me wonder if the tuner shops wont be bringing out some fritos to up the torque big time and even boost the hp by at least another 10 or so    31 months to go on my 12 acura tl lease of course audi may well come out with their new and improved 20t in that time period too    and with 400gal gasoline coming soon to a pump near you these 4cylinder engines keep getting more and more attractive    drive it like you live shades,markcincinnati
3143,January 2012,i agree on the 4cly blurb 31 months thats tough,sweendogy
3144,January 2012,i never said crappy engine i was expecting the new turbo 4 to be a power house and it is however most people know that bmw has 6 cyl engines and to sell a 46k call with a 4 cyl is a tough sell but the little engine produces some good number but in 060 and mpg bmw learned its lesson with the 318i talk about crappy engine,flightnurse
3145,January 2012,not really since mark has owned 29 audis in the past his local audi dealer will make him a great deal to get him out of that tl,flightnurse
3146,January 2012,i would love to see the deal one would get with 31 mths remaining on a lease on a 2011 tl and reselling that tl on an audi lot that sounds like a leader ad  back on the 4cyl  the old 6 was a fine engine and it sold very wellleased even better but bmw and the world is looking at 100 98 and change close today oil which will continue to roll into the pump prices even at 4550k people hate the 80 dollar gas hit 23 times a month 4cyls are here to stay for 40k im willing to pay for a strong 4 that performs better the current 6 and gets me 30mpg highway in the 012 3 add the sports pack and you have major performer with stick,sweendogy

3154,February 2012,they may have made that clear  but i dont think they were telling the truth    why then do they have far cheaper examples in europe why then do they offer a 31k 1series frankly i think claiming they dont want to offer it here is sour grapes they dont believe there to be enough of a market to warrant it andor they dont want to canibalize their own sales would someone who stretched themself to buy a new 328 rather buy a 320 probably so theyd rather just say i dont wanna    thats my uneducated guess anyway  17 ford crew 27 67 coronet rt 14 towncountry limited 09 lsubaru hse 44car history and counting,qbrozen
3155,February 2012,i dont have a problem with a 4 cylinder bmw  audi and mercedes benz have them the problem i do have is that na isnt available anymore    people ranted on and on when the dipstick went away and the cars became leasers keep it for 3 years then ditch it because of the inability to selfmaintain them shade tree mechanics used to love bmw but not these new ones and now with a turbo in all of the bmw bmw is telling dont even think of working on this car yourself they might as well remove the hood latch mechanism    as much as i like the engineering performance and economy of a turbo4 i would never buy one,fedlawman

3157,February 2012,why then do they have far cheaper examples in europe    thats not entirely accurate description of their european offering what they have there is lots of different versions and options with their smallerengine offerings obviously are cheaper to manufacture but their prices are higher than here  and by higher i mean insane    they didnt have there old bmw there were 325i and 330i positioned just belowabove in terms of hp i believe these are same engines as those offered here before 2008 they have bmw just the same if you configure one sold in german market to what sells here largest in europe you come up with some ridiculous values it would cost you there near double to get similar vehicle i am not kidding currency exchange already included bmw for 100 grand anyone a visit in bmw welts is a real eye opener a 1series with smaller engine than here can cost you there equivalent of a base 5series here if you want to pay what we pay here you come up with a base na 4cyl engine cloth seats no extras of any kind so it is not that people buy there 31mazda because they really want to and they simply dont like bmw its basicall most they can afford to buy if you add their gas station bill being about double of ours you get the picture oh no if theyd take 328 or 335 in a heart beat if they paid what we pay    people you dont even realize how tough us market is for those guys and how lucky demanding we really are they pay labor rates higher than here especially if you factor in taxes paid by the employer then they have to come here and sell it for a little more than half the price theyd command in their domestic market if you realize that you wonder how they are able to sell anything here at a profit and still offer decent perhaps not great choices    on the flip side there everybody gets choices upon choices even in lower end brands a typical 3series price sheet is two pages here for a given body style there its a twentyplus page booklet just for the same body style people rarely buy from dealers lots they order and pick it up three to six months later they often cant really test drive the car with engine they order thats regardless of brand totally different experience  2018 430i gran coupe,dino001
3158,February 2012,i agree that 47k is expensive for a 4cyl sedan heck a 528xi w a 4cyl can be optioned well into the 60k range yikes i dont know if there is a stigma about driving a 4cyl car like there used to be back in the 80s  90s the serial leasse will no doubt take the f30 out on a test drive and feel it has the same amount or more i havent driven one yet of pickup the salesman mentions its a 4cyl turbo that gets 30 something mpg on the highway the customer hasnt driven a 4 cyl car since their early 1990s toyota tercel says wow 4 cyl engines sure have changed    you got a fantastic deal on a smokin bmw w x drive coupe so you are right it is possible    bmw is a performance luxury brand in the american market performance for the masses is equated by 060 mph times they dont want a 320i na 4cyl in their stable that does the sprint in 75  85 sec  2001 prelude type sh 2015 infiniti q40 awd 2017 honda honda touring awd,nyccarguy
3159,February 2012,ok but what is the overall cost of living and average income i mean if were talking us dollars here is it just a matter of the us dollar being worth far less there im not an economics guy by any stretch of the imagination nor am i a world traveler mind you but im pretty sure something just simply costing more there means it is more expensive in relation to the average joe know what i mean    i know this is going back a ways but i know base mercedes benzes for example served taxi duty i would guess thats because they are relatively cheap no does that still hold true today are they still used for that purpose  17 ford crew 27 67 coronet rt 14 towncountry limited 09 lsubaru hse 44car history and counting,qbrozen
3160,February 2012,yes there was a loss of value of the dollar in recent years which opened the gap further than before to those insane levels but it has always been there even during strong dollar times america has always been a land of cheap cars and energy the payoff was lack of sophistication generally relatively fewer choices lower expectations of quality especially fitfinish an american buys a car used or new with an expectation of a trade in next threefive years european expects to to keep it for life even if they ultimately do not that sets a tone pretty ddodgeatically they spend much higher portion of their income and then their operating costs are also higher to their income which sets expectations very high youd have to watch some top gear comments every time they get an americanmade vehicle for a test    ford ford is sold there as family vehicle it is sold with 14 and 16 engines ford mondeocontourford is considered an middle level executive  also sold with 1618 engine in many countries there is a big tax and insurance penalty when you go over 2 litters denmark has new car registration fees at levels comparable to value of the car im not kidding  people have been known to take loans to pay off registration tax and the list goes on even germans most affluent of all europe drive mostly volkswagen ford and opels in configurations that would make americans laugh    taxi mercedes benz is nothing like mercedes benz you see here the only thing in common is the shell and the star on the hood it used to be attractive for taxi because of durability of their base na diesel engine vs price relation to other brands regardless if you buy a ford or mercedes benz you will spend much higher share of income but mercedes benz used to offer million mile durability tons of spare parts available from knock off manufacturers  2018 430i gran coupe,dino001
3161,February 2012,but im pretty sure something just simply costing more there means it is more expensive in relation to the average joe    dont want to sound condiscending but americans are really cute sometimes let me tell you what an average median income joe brithans deutchjose spanjaques the french get from life they live in a 800 sf apartment in a multiapartment house commute to work with bustrane and on weekends they drive a fivetoeight years old ford fordrenault meganeopel astra with 90110 hp engine most likely diesel dr hans or dept manager jaques have vastly better life  they live in 1500 sf house and commute in threeyearold ford mondeopeugeot 405 with 140 hp engine also diesel regional manager julio just moved into 2000 sf house and bought a new bmw 520d 4cylinder diesel with cloth seats but a keyless entry which he showed to every neighbor    well exact facts may differ slightly but thats a general tone when you understand those differences the perspective changes ddodgeatically  2018 430i gran coupe,dino001
3162,February 2012,obviously i had a typo in that statement it should have been    im not an economics guy by any stretch of the imagination nor am i a world traveler mind you but im pretty sure something just simply costing more there doesnt means it is more expensive in relation to the average joe    just keep in mind regardless of whether you find it cute or not it doesnt mean what i said is incorrect everything is relative yes if everything you say is true then the cars apparently cost a larger portion of their income although i have no idea why but since everything appears to be that way from what you are saying then it is relatively on par with all living expenses if you get my meaning    its the same thing from state to state here gas food taxes real estate all vary widely across the country i could live as a king in texas for pauper wages in nj    hell im middle management and i sure cant afford a new bimmer  17 ford crew 27 67 coronet rt 14 towncountry limited 09 lsubaru hse 44car history and counting,qbrozen

3166,February 2012,i knew what you meant to say and that was cute to me assuming that is something is true in us it must be uninissanl but lets not dwell on that i meant to be funny but i probably wasnt the fact stays that united states is a world with by far cheapest cars and energy not just in terms of currency prices but in terms of actual income percentage it is also true about other items such as certain electronics iphoneipad costs in europe about twice what it does here even more in china    the reasons for that to be the case are plenty from general output ie us is still in fact either highest of almost highest gnpcapita combined with scale even small price break could bring marginally more sales which can fuel more price breaks however the biggest difference lies in market fragmentation combined europe is about us size but each country has its own very separate ways and they dont interact in terms of retail and more redistributive economy ie higher taxation on all levels from capital to income to consumption eg euro sales tax called vat is from 17 to 25 euro income taxes are progressive reaching 50 and beyond on top bracket euro social security taxes paid by employers as surcharge go into 3050 territory all depends on the country there is also large amount of social engineering going on there as well where undesirable behavior such as owning largedisplacement engine vehicle is directly punished by the government through additional taxes and scrutiny they also excert a direct pressure on manufacturers to make or not make certain products as well a concept introduced to us just only recently all this combines into really punitive taxes and high prices of unnecessary good which cars especially luxury ones are perceived as    it gets even worse in poorer countries almost inversely proportional to their wealth explanation for that may be in volume even if mb or bmw lowered the price they would not sell more product so prices remain high to pay for higher distribution cost of smaller markets and the circle closes  2018 430i gran coupe,dino001
3167,February 2012,to me it is not really the size of the engine but its configuration there are big advantages of straight six in terms of balance smoothness power delivery sure you can make a screamer 4cyl sewing machine producing same power as a larger i6 but the experience is not the same long term durability is also an open question europeans are already going through that now with their modern diesel engines  in quest of clean quite and high power turbo diesel all advantages of old diesel resiliency low maintenance million mile durability are all but gone pour wrong fuel to your tank and you need new injectors put wrong oil and watch your car die sure they are all nice clean and quiet when new but they last just about the same as gasoline engines but still cost 30 more  2018 430i gran coupe,dino001

3183,February 2012,it helps if people answer the question asked i asked for a comparison between the acura tl and the infiniti infiniti    i think sweeny answered your question    the g is sportier and most people think its better looking the tl is more refined and some people think its better looking,fedlawman
3184,February 2012,acura has probably more value defined as features for a price they have everything is standard approach and it usually is one optionpackage i like that but it also has its limits  infiniti is going to be faster but some options can also add to the price acura can be had with manual and awd combined which is a big plus to me to me a choice would be manual rwd infiniti and awd acura also with a stick i hate that nose on acura but looks to me is something one can get used to im more interested in interiors final decision would probably be based on availability price of target configurations and actual test drive results  2018 430i gran coupe,dino001
3185,February 2012,dont know about the value comment i just maxed out options packages for both cars and its 45970 vs 46195 maxed outusing each company websites with the infiniti being a 2 hundo extranot that i would equip as such the manual trans with the 6 speed was a big deal for me when i was looking i didnot want or justify the extra 10k for the bmw the acura while having the best shifter i have ever driven looked dumpy both the tl and g handle real well the g is a little louder and a little quicker both have very nice interiors and both are great highway chrysler the tl has many buttons  the g is a little simpler but both are very nice on the inside being from the north east i didnot want to live without the awd and thought the g at the time was the better car with it being rwd bais and having the breed of cars like the old g the nissan z and gtr under the same stable vs the honda honda acura underpinnings of the tl i am dissapointed i still cannot get the g with a 6speed and awd if someone goes that route with the tl i would understand even given its looks,sweendogy
3186,February 2012,its unfortunately this market its only bmw that has it available on all 3series body styles engines drive types everybody else always knows better whats good for you you end up getting manual only on one engine one type of drive often even not on all trims doesnt matter acura acura wagon only auto infiniti lexus mercedes benz audi cadillac everybody but bmw limits the availability  2018 430i gran coupe,dino001
3187,February 2012,i agree the market and bmw does do a great job at that  but how about a 328x335x manual convertible  looks like audi dropped the manual for the base audi convert and audi wagoni would bet its because few people actually look for the manual option any more and it wound not surprise me if bmw goes to retiring the option as well chatter was they were not going to bring a manual bmw to the states but backlash from the passionate made it happen    but lets not forget bmw also offers free wipers and oil changes on your new rig as well for the first 4 years,sweendogy
3188,February 2012,my question to the op are you buying or leasing    the infinitix is an absolute road rocket it is very balanced  turns almost like theres an axis underneath the car dynamically its a rwd chassis so its going to be the better performer    the tl is going to be a better ride not buicklike as some suggest but very refined from what ive read from magazines  other th posters the shawd really transforms the handling characteristics of an otherwise fwd nose heavy luxury sedan its not as fast as the ag but its no slouch    good luck  keep us informed test drives buying experience  2001 prelude type sh 2015 infiniti q40 awd 2017 honda honda touring awd,nyccarguy

3191,February 2012,surprised that nobody is sticking up for the tl shawd    i think the shawd is great without switching anything off i was able to slightly oversteer coming out of a corner if thats your thing my current car has an esoteric sequence of commands to turn off the nanniesonly to be repeated next time it is started    the tl had a great amount of passenger room nice dash i dont mind buttons and was very compliant over bumps seams etc as far as acceleration is concerned it is very similar to all the others really not that different only the 335 felt more lively in day to day driving felt like all the torque was available now    i like the old beak style as well didnt purchase one so i guess in a marketing sense it would count as a failure    i ranked it higher than the infiniti because it felt more refined and seemed more expensive i had the first gthe pontiac5 and had a great time with it    i didnt go with a tl because i decided on a cpo lexus which was more tossable and had a lower price than a new tl it had similar refinement as the tl and is rwd which isnt as great a benefit as some would argueespecially in the is which tames much of the sportiness the rwd is supposed to bestow    so if it were up to me in a tl shawd vs infiniti id go with the tl,ivan_99
3192,February 2012,i had just gone through this same comparison myself although i also threw the audi audi into the mix ive always been a honda driver so i figured the acura tl would be the next logical step i test drove it 3 or 4 times really wanting to like it but each time i was just left wanting something more i personally didnt mind the exterior but the interior had too many reminders that this really is just an expensive honda clunky nav system old thin strip digital clock buttons galore on the console the car was fast but it was also pretty heavy and just felt big in my opinion the shawd kicked in when you accelerated around tight corners but most of the time youre just in regular fwd    i had my heart set on the audi  i loved the gas mileage the refined interior and i actually liked the pickup of the 4 cylinder turbo better than the tl the only thing i hated was the a la carte option pricing how the hell can you not offer a trip computer or dual zone climate control or bluetooth in a standard trim and the arrogance of the sales people who wouldnt come down from msrp    finally i decided to test drive the infinitix and it was just the perfect balance with plenty of power  felt more powerful than the tl  and a refined interior with all the right options i could care less about the nav and the infiniti lets you have that easy to use screen with all the functionality less the 2k nav the tl without the nav looked even more like a honda and youd have to rely solely on voice control which was less than impressive during the test drive    i ultimately decided to lease the infinitix as there are some great deals right now with the pending redesign coming for 2013 ive had the car about 2 weeks and am really happy with everything except the mpg which i knew id start to really dislike as soon as i started filling up the tank i think the acura tl would be best in the long term as the reliability and resale are unmatched but my plan is to lease the infinitix for 3 years and hope that acura gets their act together so i can buy something long term when my lease is up    hope this helps,dbledmndk2

3196,February 2012,i wish audi would do something with their 2 liter engine it needs more hp then 211 hp with bmw now having a 240hp turbo 4 audi needs to increase theirs to the ttss 256hp if they did that i really think sweeny complaints that bmw cars are expensive the base price for the top tier audi is 44k and it only comes with a turbo 4,flightnurse
3197,February 2012,the cpo does add valuebut i suppose that is up to the purchaser to decide if they want to pay for this value    did you attempt to negotiate when i was looking at a cpo 335 coupe they dropped 2k off the msrp without any real haggling im not certain if that was their absolute bottom i assume it wasnt    but of course this was a different dealer time of year salesman state etc etc    the bmw cpo i believe is transferable too so that is an added benefit as well    i only find wow deals when im not looking to buy,ivan_99
3198,February 2012,i was just tire kicking so i didnt try to negotiate    im just surprised they price them so high i know they will negotiate but i just wonder how many people they scare away    used cars are such a high profit item for dealers because they get the cars at wholesale and mark them up tremendously unlike with new cars buyers are almost completely in the dark as to how much the dealer payed for the car  theres no foundation to stand on for buyers to negotiate,fedlawman
3199,February 2012,so the g lineup is going to be getting a redesign for the 2013 model year i was hoping to get some peoples thoughts as to what you think infiniti is going to do to keep the g fresh innovative etc this is especially in light of the new 3series with the turbo 4cyl and kick butt mpg    look forward to hearing the discussion,smarty666
3200,February 2012,fedlawmanwas at my bmw dealer last week they had a 12 bmw loaded up and a new 12 bmw loaded they said they were only taking offers of msrp on both    interestingly given that scenario my 11 bmw was about 9k less discounted than its 12 brother for that large of a delta the bmw would not have been on my shopping list last year    sweenyou and i dont agree often but i agree with you assessment regarding the value proposition of the recent bmw update its entering into territory that other cars really make more sense    dont get me wrong theres nothing that drives like a 3 especially with the turbo 30 as a side note there is zero lag with mine but when the bmw 4 cyl starts creeping toward 50k loaded and the bmw creeps towards 60k loaded its time to look at some other vehicles    to me this is where the infiniti starts making more sensethe price creep of the 3 series puts it thereinfiniti didnt have to do anything    those of you whove been around here for awhile know of my fondness for the tl but i think acura is going to go in a different direction with the next iteration i hope they bring out a tls before they move on they usually do but im not certain theyll be as edgy with the new tl to me that would be a real shame    audisat least around sw oh have very little at the dealerships that you can find im seeing more recently but stocking levels are still very thin and i dont think its because they sell a ton of them as they cant if they dont have new stock drove an s4 nice car not worth a premium over my 335 nor over an even larger premium over a tl shawd    imho mercedes benz c or e class dont even come close to those mentioned above    gas prices are once again artificially inflated so perhaps bmw is putting themselves in a good position with the 4 cyl in the 3 and 5 series american public is fickle theyll spend an extra 10k premium to get better mpg that amounts to 3k over the course of a hybrids life    its cominggas prices are due for a monumental crash given that demand had been so tepid regardless of what people are saying about china and india and political posturing usually amounts to nothing but noise how long do you really think iran can keep from selling oil in europe mpg on all vehicles is advancing at a very rapid rate so all of this means that a collapse is coming well see how many want a 50k 4 cyl luxury car then  2018 acura tchrysler sh awd aspec,graphicguy
3201,February 2012,    sorry about thatlooks like i started into a freefall dodgeble with the above post i dont get here that often these days  2018 acura tchrysler sh awd aspec,graphicguy
3202,February 2012,fedman it appears that bmw and porsches had thier value much better then others however if you look at the base price for a new 911 you are talking 80k base    the cpo bmw for 40k seems about right a fully loaded bmw is almost 60k    you should be able to find a cpo 2009 off lease with less then 40k which would increase the warranty to 100k for mid to low 20s,flightnurse
3203,February 2012,currently infiniti has the infiniti for the entry into the g sedan which also gets better mpg then the thirsty infiniti right now i dont think a turbo 4 is in the works for infiniti however they need to raise their cafe for get fined now since nissan has some great diesels in europe and japan not too sure why they dont bring these engines over to the us    regarding design infiniti has been on a evolution of their cars so maybe a refresh would help sales,flightnurse
3204,February 2012,yeah audi needs to bump hp which i have mentioned before but the engine does have a good enuf torque unlike the acura  still in elpps has what 180lbs i like when you say the base price for a top audi car what what whatmoving on i agree audi as also expensive when compared to base level japaniese comps for sure the tl g give you more for sure to bad they dont throw in free wipers and oil changes like the great bmw maintaince plan iphone sorry for the mistypes    flight nurse  why did you need my age again ,sweendogy
3205,February 2012,i think were going to see a bigger difference between the infiniti and the infiniti currently the mpg and price differences are too small in my opinion so i wouldnt be surprised to see the infiniti end up with a turbo engine and the infiniti to continue on its merry way with a new more sporty exterior and led daytime running lights i think there are some pictures floating around out there from a recent auto show hinting at the new g coupe  looks a lot sportier like the nissan z,dbledmndk2
3206,February 2012,you should be able to find a cpo 2009 off lease with less then 40k which would increase the warranty to 100k for mid to low 20s    based on the stickers i saw i am very sure i cannot get a cpo 2009 bmw for less than 30k    fortunately im not interested in a bmw after driving it i didnt like the response of the throttle its not turbo lag per se but there is definitely a disconnected feeling that i dont like    the only bmw i would consider right now is an e90 bmw ive given myself an upper limit of 60k but id prefer to stay below 50k im in no hurry so i can wait for the right car and deal,fedlawman
3207,February 2012,i was first really interested in the infiniti when it came out but when i saw the mpg rating which is the same as a rwd infiniti for its size engine it completely turned me off i hope infiniti rectifies it    i agree with the nissan diesels in other countries why they dont bring them over i highly doubt they will especially with the m hybrid it seems that at least infiniti is going to do a hybrid as their fuel efficient choice of technology    i agree infiniti is much like bmw in doing an evolution of their vehicles rather than a revolution so i expect only a moderate refresh will be done on the g lineup if they go in the direction of the essence concept then they should be in good shape design wise,smarty666
3208,March 2012,from what i read nissan and mb are getting together on a 6 being a nissan fan i dont know what to expect because from what im hearing mb is doing most of the work should be interesting  i dont think its going to be ready by 2013 so i dont know of any real update for the g is really in store  atleast what i have read  please share any links detailing the new g,sweendogy
3209,March 2012,the g is in its 6th model year 20072012 its due for a redesign sales have sagged on the g and with the new 3 series i cant see any logical reason to prolong the redesign into a 7th model year i dont know of any luxury make breadbutter model that has gone that long without a moderatemajor redesign,smarty666

3290,April 2012,sweendogy  ill agree with you that price absolutely matters in this and any category everybodys got a price ceiling whether its a dollar amount or a payment amount whether you are talking honda vs ford this current crop of ellps the 5 e audi group and even the 7 s audi models    price drove my purchase i had equity in my acura bmw offered generous discounts and incentives so i got a car ive been dreaming about since the late 1990s    i love the way the infinitix drives theres something to be said for the fact that the car has an extra almost 100 horsepower it is a rocket its power is intoxicating it is faster than my 328xi for sure so you could say the infiniti offers a faster car for the same or for less money i dont personally think faster equates to better    cars in this class arent all about 0  60 mph times there is so much more to the equation that i know you know otherwise you wouldnt be driving a g youd be driving a 50 ford or chevrolet ss  2001 prelude type sh 2015 infiniti q40 awd 2017 honda honda touring awd,nyccarguy
3291,April 2012,when i drive cars one thing i judge them by is their comfortable driving speed or natural loafing sweet spot as you so nicely put it hondaing to me it is the driving speed at which the car feels just right driving at not full throttle wheres the fire my wifes water just broke and her contractions are 2 minutes apart driving    my prelude feels perfect at 75 even though the tach needle is over 3k anything over that and i feel im driving the prelude fast    my former acura felt just right at 80 which seems logical given that it is heavier than my prelude has more sound deadening material and an actual overdriven 5th gear    ive had the bmw up at 90 for a few brief moments and the car was as you and my wife have pointed out is scary fast the car is just inceredibly planted at speed  2001 prelude type sh 2015 infiniti q40 awd 2017 honda honda touring awd,nyccarguy

3295,April 2012,agree the refinement is something for sure im sure the new bmw 3 for 2012 should help the dated interior and nav setup as others have pointed out audi continues to excel at interiors and is the standard for the class for such the 25 or more msrp difference is hard to ignore for the 335 vs infiniti please dont argue with me  ive priced them option for option and even the msrp for the 328 balloons to 50k i think nyc did a great job getting the deal on a great car and i wish him well and i hope to see him on the merritt one day  my argument has never been the g as a better car but a better value for a lot of the same things the bmw does the g or acura might never be the top pick for car and driver mag or the true driver but in consumer reports they have consistently ranked better an unbiased news rag with no advertising support i think the true driver a person who wants the true sport and performance is going to get the 335 or 328  with sport and stick other then that set up these cars in this class are very close regardless of price ,sweendogy

3298,April 2012,hey stick i agree with you to a point regarding depreciation price is a relative thing if i couldnt afford a new bmw yes i would go for a cpo bmw but i keep my cars longer then most currently i have no plans on selling my 05 if i had to sell one of my bmw the 2011 is a goner    my partner hasnt made up is mind what car he wants he was edging towards a bmw i was sort of pushing towards a 740i same engine with 15 more hp but he started looking at used audis he is looking at price trying to save some money so who knows what we will buy but for him price is playing a factor,flightnurse
3299,April 2012,sweeny the reason why you dont understand the first paragraph is simple it was directed at you comparing a jeep to a bmw    with the 8 spd coming to 300c the might g will have major competition in the best bang for the buck for under 40k the 300c will be a major player just as long as chrysler doesnt progdodge the 300c to go into eco mode so quickly even bmw will have to watch out,flightnurse

3314,April 2012,im not exactly sure if cr is a publication that i would use as the basis for my automotive purchases weve been down the cr argument path so many times before here on edmunds i would assume we dont need to go down it again i must admit however that i am not a subscriber but i have taken to reading crs automotive tests and comments of late because of reading some of the posts here on edmunds i was encouraged to see that cr now seems to have more subjective prose not much more but a little more pertaining to the cars under their review in other words the cr reviews i have read over the past couple of months no longer seem to have been written by a vulcan indeed the test reports and comparisons seem to have been written pretty much by actual humans    i read here posts that discuss reliability one of the words that needs to be used carefully and often the poster will suggest that the reason they didnt seriously consider a german car for instance is that they are unreliable the poster will continue to say that they went with the japanese brand they chose because of its reliability    i know there are lemons from the us europe and asia  and i know someone will likely have an anecdote to share about how his audi or volvo or buick was constantly in the shop or broke down frequently and often the same person will laud the absolute reliability of their fillintheblank car from japan or korea or somewhere else    i am also going to pass along what might be considered anecdotes but they might also be considered data points i cant remember ever having an unreliable car including my first poc which was a 1963 chrysler newport moreover since my wife and i have had over 30 german cars i can assure you we really would have to go some to claim any of them even the ones from the 70s were unreliable    it is very difficult to find a car today  from anywhere  that would be able to be called unreliable    here however is another word that probably should enter our vocabularies and that has both a difference and a distinction  that word is durable or durability    the issue in my mind is not how reliable the car is  hell all of these cars are reliable they wont leave you stranded and they wont break or have anything major go wrong with them for at least 50000 miles  many of them will go double that before any real coin is required to replace a failed part    what i have learned  now having about 40000 miles experience with two japanese cars one infiniti and one acrua is that the japanese cars have the reputation of being durable and being able to be kept so without breathtakingly expensive maintenance once the warranty expires    the german cars are just as reliable imho but  after the warranty expires  they can be breathtakingly expensive to maintain and they stand the chance of not being as durable as their asian counterparts or at least they are perceived to be less durable than the asians    i am not certain what exactly cr means when they speak of the reliability of such and such brand  for from where i sit theyre all very reliable these days i am constantly told however that my acura is likely to be the most durable car i have ever had but often the word reliable and durable are used as if they are different words but lack distinction    makes my head spin    are german cars less reliable than japanese cars you cant make that case with me in fact since i have already had to have the front brake rotors on my 2012 tl turned due to warpage and the rear differential oil changed at great expense i might add and the car only has 15000 miles on it i would say it is the least reliable no check that least durable car i have had this buick    my 2009 audi came will all maintenance paid as did my wifes 2008 bmw  so far the acura and the infiniti seem to visit the dealership for some multihundred dollar required maintenance procedure about every 3750 miles    if i only were looking at cars as being reliable i would say the germans audi and bmw would be at the top of my list since i only had to visit the dealership about once every 10 or 15000 miles and when i did the visit was no charge    my point is we need to use the correct word to describe these cars  and i suspect what we mean when we say reliable is durable    these cars today are all reliable  some however are more durable than others i suspect the germans can be as durable as the japanese with breathtakingly expensive maintenance procedures applied regularly after the 50000 initial warranty expires but since most of these cars are leased the germans most certainly most folks get rid of the cars before durability becomes a factor    cr is best used to buy toasters not cars if you axe me confuse,markcincinnati

3318,April 2012,there are some services besides oil changes that are vital  necessary for a vehicles long term durability such as brake fluid transmission fluid differential fluid why was that needed so early btw coolant  chevrolet plugs    remember a dealerships service department usually makes the dealer more money than they make selling new cars most coolant  transmission fluid changes on honda are simple drain  fill procedures the dealer can charge more money for a power purge service of these same procedures unless the car specifies something i mentioned above be changed or done just tell them youd like just the oil  filter changed  2001 prelude type sh 2015 infiniti q40 awd 2017 honda honda touring awd,nyccarguy
3319,April 2012,simply open the manual and get just the recommended service that the engineers that built your auto recommend dealers publish their own over and above suggested maint items but they are just money makers and serve no real purpose to the operability or longevity of your car ive had an infiniti for almost 10 years95k miles and probably havent spent more than a 1500 in routine maint the whole time oil changes are about 3040 and the dealer always rotated the tires for free during the original warranty period now costco does it for free as part of their tire deal thats about 150 a year and there were several years where it was just two oil changes and that was it total repairs to this vehicle are also under 500 although i do need a new power antenna all in all very inexpensive except for the fact that it sucks gas,m6user
3320,April 2012,well before i bought my 328 i went to the service dept to talk what free really means you see those everything everything everything but tires free commercials all the time surely enough alignment is not covered and of course wouldnt you do a fuel induction system cleaning prices 200 for alignment and 200 for cleaning so your free maintence visit turns into dropping over four hundred bucks for services that can be performed at third in any other place and who knows if you even need one  2018 430i gran coupe,dino001
3321,April 2012,while very long your post did include interesting points but i do one again take issue with the toaster comment they have available data for 10 years worth of data for each cars reliability so the sample size is bigger then one audi and one acura  i agree with you that if you are looking new the first 50k in driving should be pretty worry free plus if its not the standard warrantee should help with the major items  and any savy person should know whats real required and recommended services and know what makes up one service the german lease argument very true but what if your looking at a used bmw  shouldnt you look at an unbiased mag like cr who has 10yrs of data to make an informed decision  or just ask a buddy who has had one reliabledurable audi that he owned from new  crs sample size  to big to ignoresorry for the long post,sweendogy
3322,April 2012,so far the acura and the infiniti seem to visit the dealership for some multihundred dollar required maintenance procedure about every 3750 miles    interesting you should mention that as the infiniti salesman who dealt on my 2007 pontiac5 lease admitted that the warranty would still be in effect even if the recommended maintenance aside from oil changes was not done i dont know if that has changed from recommended to required    reminds me when i brought my 08 eclass in for its 1yr maintenance for 250 not only did i get the checklist of things done but i got a ding over the rear fender wheel opening for no extra charge sick ,carnaught

3325,April 2012,about the tl or g both good cars either would work g is a bit fuel thirsty so thats something to consider if you can find a used tl with sh awd thats the one to get they handle superbly    regarding maintenance tls really dont require more maintenance than any other honda product the sh awd models require a little more but not much more    price for maintenance on a tl shouldnt vary much from a honda either    bmw serviceon the one previous to my current one i swapped out the run flats as they were horrid the new run flats on my current bmw are much better aside from that everwhthing else was covered including brakes and windshield wipers  the only two things that required service other than oil changes tire rotations    ive used costco gasoline almost exclusively in my vehicles my sons vehicles and gfs vehicles for 10 years never had any problems with the fuel system needing to be cleanedever    i throw in a bottle of techron into the gas tank every 10000 miles just to be on the safe side  2018 acura tchrysler sh awd aspec,graphicguy
3326,April 2012,bmw serviceon the one previous to my current one i swapped out the run flats as they were horrid the new run flats on my current bmw are much better    before i got my bmw i read about those terrible runflats awful people say just loud and harsh then the delivery came and this supposedly terrible tires i got sports pack mind you so those are 17 performance summer came to be quite allright of course my point of reference is 2008 sti so i may have a little skewed perception now almost six months and 7k miles passed and im still not feeling those tires being so awful yes i noticed a little more noise on certain types of surface than one could expect in an entry lux car but im not sure if similar performance gfts wouldnt be the same those are continentals perhaps bridgestones are worse or perhaps rfts are simply getting better i even read that certain small punctures can even be fixed now if one doesnt let the tire to go on zero pressure for too long read you get flat you pull to the next tire store  not sure if its really true people say a lot of things  2018 430i gran coupe,dino001
3327,April 2012,we all seem to agree i think that bmw free maintenance is 1 built in to the price of the car and 2 has extended intervals since bmw started including it wherever you sit on this theres no doubt in my mind that it adds value i was looking through my own 328xis vehicle computer and found that my car will require the following scheduled maintenance    15000 miles  oil change within year 1  25000 miles  front brake pads within year 2  29000 miles  inspection i  major service within year 2  30000 miles  rear brake pads within year 2    now lets use that schedule and see what else i can muster up    45000 miles  oil change    thats it for the maintenance that is included in the cost of my bmw 2 oil changes at the dealership  1 major service  front pads  rear pads add up to something    now not everyone does the 20k miles per year that i do so they dont get the full value of the included maintenance    heres where things get interesting when my lease is up my car is going to have 50000 miles im going to have a few choices  decisions to make    option 1 is obviously just to turn my car in and walk away    option 2 is to buy my car from the dealer not bmwfs after the lease is up  hopefully be able to negotiate a price thats significantly cheaper than the lease end buy out of a little more than 26k say i can buy it for 21k it would be a nice used car if i buy the car i wouldnt go for the cpo warranty on my previous x3 they wanted 3k to certify it but i most certainly would go for the extended maintenance pkg that covers the maintenance up to 100k miles imo even at the 2k msrp think i could maybe get it cheaper it will get me    50000 miles  front brake pads  maybe rotors  60000 miles  inspection ii major service incl oil filter brake fluid trans fluid coolant  75000 miles  oil change  90000 miles  inspection i semimajor service    id also be financing the buyout    option 3 is to lease another car there most likely wont be these crazy incentives on the f30 328xi that were on my car so im sure a lease with the same padodgeeters 20k miles per year is going to be upwards of 650  675 month which is too rich for my blood    option 4 would be to buy a similar car to mine that has literally 12 the miles my only problem with that is dealers seem to have high asking prices on loaded up off lease cpo cream puffs    ill see what happens for now i love this freakin car  2001 prelude type sh 2015 infiniti q40 awd 2017 honda honda touring awd,nyccarguy

3333,May 2012,flightnurse made a comment to me a few weeks back about me getting to see what my 328xis awd system can do in the rain now ive always really questioned awds effectiveness in the rain thinking of it as more of a useful tool for snow traction unless bmw bmw is so transparent that i dont know how well it is working kind of similar to my preludes atts i really didnt know how good it was until i drove my acura around some of the same tight corners and the front tires were fighting the stability control whereas my prelude pulled around the corner    one of the benefits to having to be at work at 730 am 6 days a week is there arent too many cars on the road when i leave my house at 630 am it started pouring early this am my 3 year old woke up with a 102 fever and a stomach virus well before 5 so the roads were saturated with lots of nice puddles in addition to being slick i put my 328xi through the paces on my way to i 95 only a few times when i had the transmission in ds was i able to break traction only to have the stability control tuck me back into place so i dont know how the awd performed maybe some of you with the 335xi or sweens pontiac5x can comment how the awd works in the rain    i can tell you that driving down i 95 in the torrential rain my 328xi was sure footed and rock solid i looked down at my speedo and saw i was going 80 without breaking a sweat    in the dry gorgeous spring weather weve been having ive been able to hit the magical triple digit mark during passing maneuvers unless you are a torque junkie not that theres anything wrong with that my 230 hp is just perfect for public road consumption    5 12 weeks and over 2300 miles as you can tell im one happy bmw driver  2001 prelude type sh 2015 infiniti q40 awd 2017 honda honda touring awd,nyccarguy

3399,May 2012,my preference of stick shift has nothing to do with performance track times 060 im not that good of a driver to actually take advantage of the edge even if it existed i dont prefer it because of the fuel economy as modern autos are either better or almost as good depending on who makes them my preference for stick shift is only about one thing  it is feel of a connection between the throttle pedal and wheels feedback that can be provided only by a mechanincal grip direct friction between clutch plates no matter what fluid driven by fins in a classic hydrokinetic transmission aka torque converter will give you different feel ive never driven dsgsmgdct but i can only imagine those transmissions as being the only equivalent device to facilitate similar feel you get from manual transmission i could let go the pedal its the connection id miss if switched to normal slushbox    to be completely fair the slushbox on the bmw loaner i had for couple of weeks came close to what id consider acceptable replacement it was really first premium segment car i had opportunity to drive for more extended time and i almost liked the transmission i opted for the manual simply because it was possibly last chance i still had an optionsame with the sixinline engine btw    im resigned to strong possibility of getting a slushbox for my next car  hopefully long time from now its not going to be terrible or anything like that  just a little sad thats all end of an era but since there was a stay of the execution i used it  2018 430i gran coupe,dino001

3403,May 2012,as i watch the rangers and devils pick each other apart hockey is alive and well up east i would like to once again mix things up we all know the acura is going to die or is it the tl  as acura introduces a honda based sedan  2 4cy options real drivers will select the 24 manual drive one and ask yourself but in presnet size looks like a potential player when will we retire the tl or acura in this chat its about time im asking for one gine and if i remember correclty the hosts were asking these same members to rate or talk about the new acura isx im talking to the hosts as this is the most popular forum at edmunds you are so very welcome while we are at it  the caddy cts a car i like has to go as well with the new caddy ats no car co should have 2 in the entry level its entry for a reason    save the manuals,sweendogy
3404,May 2012,sweendogy    excellent hockey game im not happy with the outcome as far as the acura is concerned its nothing more than a glorified honda which in its current iteration hasnt exactly gotten glowing reviews the 24 that will be available with a manual transmission and electric power steering  yuck is a luxo version of the honda si  2001 prelude type sh 2015 infiniti q40 awd 2017 honda honda touring awd,nyccarguy

3408,May 2012,quite possible they wil consolidate in theory a lot of overlap with the 3 models heck 4 if the rl is still around so logically you cold replace the acura acura and tl with 2 models given that the i is just out i assume the acura would be the causualty  2018 hyundai hyundai sport mine and 2013 acura acura awd wifes,stickguy
3409,May 2012,thats all speculations i dont see them discontiuing the tl the acura probablywith the addition of the acura the acura is a redundant car now,billyperksii
3410,May 2012,one could say with the new rl comming soon  the tl is a redundant car but again i dont know also have to look at whats selling and if recent history of the tl would suggest it could be on the chopping block given its sales slide since the 0708 redu,sweendogy
3411,May 2012,there is no way tl will go acura is definitely the one if something goes i think the us market is just too small and too tough to support car like that it probably costs them too much vs what they can charge in volumes those things are selling i actually like it but i know when i like something it wont sell acura being based on economy car spreads the costs much better    the problem i cannot see how in the world they could make anything close to acura experience with acura the thing is based on honda platform sick whereas acura was based on eurojdm honda which were positioned similarly to us ellps and sold at appropriate prices so you know the pedigree of acura is much more noble than coming acura this is just another example of acura and honda losing their way they are undoubtedly going through some kind of crisis  2018 430i gran coupe,dino001

3414,May 2012,speculating on whether the acura or tl or both will go away is futile    i believe acura will likely maintain a 3car lineup acura at the top acura at the bottom and something in between lets just call it the tchrysler for now,fedlawman

3418,May 2012,nice write up    ive always liked the prelude and yours looks just amazing youve really taken good care of it,fedlawman
3419,May 2012,i dont see acura stopping the slide out of the premium class if the emphasis based on dealer inventory continues on obviously tarted up honda no matter how nice with fwd and 5 or 6 speed autos    my opinion is that acura needs to offer the entire lineup with shawd and nothing less than a 6spd auto moving toward 8spd autos and if possible keeping stick shifts if for no other reason than marketing    the direction acura seems to be moving is to build nice cars  that neither offend once the beak styling is banished to at least the 12 tl level if not moreso nor excite visually at least the current and apparent upcoming future direction is to slowly continue to slide out of the premium class one 100000 nsx doesnt change anything    driving my 2012 tl shawd advance is very much like driving the previous generation audi audi known as the c6 perhaps a 2009 or 2010 model    that may be damning with faint praise or it may be simply mild not wild praise that acura in 2012 can build a decent 2009 audi audi clone that isnt as good looking    in two years i move to a new car  at this point acura will get a looksee but im thinking so will infiniti and audi and cadillac the acura will have to step up its game    today acura reminds me in the pecking order of the world as the japanese volkswagen confuse,markcincinnati
3420,May 2012,that neither offend once the beak styling is banished to at least the 12 tl level if not moreso    the ol beak works for some of us reminds me of a time many years ago before marriage in venice where i saw a stunning italian lady she had a beakbut somehow it worked for me,ivan_99
3421,June 2012,it appears that acura has a excellent lease rates and 09 financing right now so this could also be why it is selling very well    gee do you have any data data on this so we go from dealers have tons of inventory and i havent seen one so they are not selling well in long island and phoenix to it is selling very well i dont think the heavy incentives are for the 2013 and if so ill let you do the research to see if acura offered any incentives last year hey if you dont like the acura brand thats fine but at least be objective,m6user
3422,June 2012,stick you are right about the 09 is for the 2012 but the leases of 399 and 499 are for the 2013 not bad for 2400 down unlike bmw where they want 3500 to 4k down for those prices,flightnurse
3423,June 2012,gee do you have any data data on this    httpwwwacuracomtoolsshoppingcurrentoffersaspxmodelacudodgeodelyeasubaru013,flightnurse
3424,June 2012,i dont lease but are those prices really that good with so much money down and in my zip the tech package lease is 449 with 3800 at signing inc 1st payment i think both are fwd too so add more  for the awd option    but the bmw is a lot more expensive so even with another 115k up front if the prices are about the same monthly then sounds like the bmw is a better deal  2018 hyundai hyundai sport mine and 2013 acura acura awd wifes,stickguy
3425,June 2012,i dont lease either so i really dont know if the lease prices are good or bad but can compare numbers when you consider the bmw x3 similarly equipped is substantially more msrp than the acura the deals are not that far apart so i would hardly say acura is offering huge incentives to move product,m6user
3426,June 2012,well its not huge incentive and i didnt see it described as such its just an excellent lease rate bmw is known for offering excellent lease deals too i dont see great leasing deals as a big oh no we must do this to move product i see it as a business ford lease payments are generally lower than purchase payments so its a way to attract a segment of the market that might otherwise balk at product ownership  plus if the consumer is new to consideration of the brand its a way to get them to sample the product for a few years without the downside of longterm ownership  moderator    need help navigating kirstiehedmundscom  or send a private message by hyundaiing on my name    share your vehicle reviews,Kirstie_H
3427,June 2012,bmwquite frankly ive yet to hear any car sales person say that business was badat least not to a potential customer i usually hear them say that every car they are trying to sell is in short supply    than you dont anyone personally in the business i have a nephew that is an auto tech and a friend that ive known for years that sells acuras both of which pretty much tell me how it is having purchased over 40not leased i think i can seperatge the truth from the flack and dont believe just any auto salesman its not like i walked into a dealership and was told something by some salesman i dont know and repeated it in these forums please give me more credit than that,m6user
3428,June 2012,acuras are sportier than lexus but not as soorty sic as a bmw or audi    i dont know what standards youre using to establish sportiness but to me and many others any car with pretensions to sportiness should be rwd and since some lexi are reardrive but acuras arent they are usually behind the curve in this respect    acuras ads tout the technical enhancements of the car not their driving characteristics for guys like me the tech toys are a secondary consideration at best  2000 bmw bmw 2001 bmw bmwc,andys120
3429,June 2012,i do not lease either there is no advantage for me to lease but im sure one could with a 700 score get the same deal with less money out of pocket    the x3 has a better residual value then the acura last i saw the residual of a x3 was 53 this was for a 3 year lease,flightnurse
3430,June 2012,the x3 has a better residual value then the acura    this is from a post by a host here at edmunds that provides lease info    acuras april buy rate lease money factor and residual value for a 36month lease of a 2013 acura base with 10000 miles per year are 00190 and 67 respectively for consumers who qualify for its top aka super preferred credit tier    carscom has 51 for 2012 acura and 47 for 2012 x3 for a 3 year lease they didnt have 2013 acura in the system    the following is from alg    luxury brand residual value rankings  1lexus  2 acura  3 infiniti  4 mercedes benz mercedes benz  5 audi    only brands above the luxury average were ranked    i know the last one is of brands and not a specific model but it makes me wonder how an x3 could be higher than a acura if the brand was not even in the top five    i couldnt find anything that indicated the x3 has a higher residual value then a acura maybe you could shed some light on why you think that,m6user
3431,June 2012,675 looks right i looked at the terms and msrp was 35210 and the residual was 2100 or so comes out to 67    might help on the lease but terrible if you wanted to buy it at the end  2018 hyundai hyundai sport mine and 2013 acura acura awd wifes,stickguy
3432,June 2012,might be closer in residual if one looked at a 12kyear mileage lease it seems those are more common but im just guessing here for all i know they could be just as far apart  moderator    need help navigating kirstiehedmundscom  or send a private message by hyundaiing on my name    share your vehicle reviews,Kirstie_H
3433,June 2012,bmwuser the statements from you on acura are correct about sales of the acura and acura  here is a recent article from usa today jamesrhealey posted above but somehow missed this settles the debate     and the only reason people think the acura has worse resid value is because its not a bmw ive seen this arguement before,sweendogy
3434,June 2012,andyi was speaking mainly about acura vs lexus if youre to pick the sportier my keyboard works of the two it would be acura ive recommended the tl sh awd to a lot of people its a great car made even greater by the  it sells for    bmwit sounds like youre looking for affirmation to buy or lease the acura believe me youll get all the encouragement youll ever want to buy a new vehicle from this crowd matter of fact we relish doing it  2018 acura tchrysler sh awd aspec,graphicguy
3435,June 2012,andyi was speaking mainly about acura vs lexus if youre to pick the sportier my keyboard works of the two it would be acura ive recommended the tl sh awd to a lot of people its a great car made even greater by the  it sells for    i have to reiterate i guess im aware that lexus makes some distinctly unsporty vehicles rxlses but since they make some good rear drive machinery and acura has only got the new nsx most would say that in general lexus is the sportier of the two    to put it another way a rwd is is sportier to me than an awd acura and i think most would agree with me  2000 bmw bmw 2001 bmw bmwc,andys120
3436,June 2012,i dont think you can argue one is sportier than the other both lines have much to offer but lag behind the europeans in dynamics and sophistication imo    yes acura is fwd and awd  which is a negative in the sportluxury segment but they have sweet shifting manuals and refined suspension tuningdynamics    lexus otoh has more rwd cars but they tend to be front heavy for a rwd and a manual shifter is only available on the lexus    ultimately i think both acura and lexus fall well below bmw and audi in terms of innovation design performance and cache none of which matters to the majority of consumers we are enthusiasts but most people shopping ellpss care about getting a 30gb hard drive and air conditioned seats for the lowest price,fedlawman
3437,June 2012,bmwit sounds like youre looking for affirmation to buy or lease the acura    not at all why would anybody come here to look for affirmation on buying a suv its just that the connissantion hit on a vehiclebrand that im interested in only acura we ever owned was a used acura i bought my son for graduation many years ago so im not a brand loyalist by any means    i dont lease but i am in fact looking hard at several different vehicles both suv and sedan from different makers still cant decide if i want to get into an ellps or stay with a suv i do more thananal could apply here enough research on my own and have a pretty good handle on whats out there to be looking for affirmation from anybody just looking for good solid informationnot biased opinions,m6user
3438,June 2012,the dealership when my partner and i were at the bmw dealer a couple of weeks back and test drove a bmw we were talking to him about the x3 and i asked about leases he said the residual was 53 higher then any other suv in its class,flightnurse
3439,June 2012,i understand however i just find it very onesided to question my info that i got from a personal friend in the business and from personal experience of physically visiting dealerships and ask me for data to prove it then turn around and give me a number from a salesman and make it sound like a fact what a crock i guess its all right for you to believe a bmw salesman but acura salesman are just shysters ok i get where youre coming from,m6user
3440,June 2012,i think the sales people if you have a relationship with them outside of being a buyer are a great way to gauge how well a car is selling as bmwuser has pointed out    i also use my eye on whats on the road as flightnurse does to keep this on topic i think ive seen maybe 4 f30 bmw on the road since it was introduced in february because nobody buys rwd bmw in the north east anymore    another way is to check out the ads in your local paper if an acura dealer runs an ad that advertises lease deals leader ad for a base acura a base tl a base acura and then has a picture of the new acura with a caption that says 5 in stock w tech pkg available for immediate delivery or order yours today then you know you are probably going to be lucky with a 500 off sticker discount    manufacturers can skew data results in their favor to make it look like they have a hot product a units sales numbers might be way up from last year but you dont know how many were produced acura knew its 1st gen acura was due for replacement and not selling hondaing to expectations so they could have scaled production way down  2001 prelude type sh 2015 infiniti q40 awd 2017 honda honda touring awd,nyccarguy

3442,June 2012,i also use my eye on whats on the road as flightnurse does    i think all of us that have a great deal of interest in automobiles do this i have been known to stalk cars on chevroletways to get a good look at them from different angles however ive noticed over the years that unless im specifically looking for something it could pass me by and and i wouldnt even notice it thats why i wont offer an opinion on how well something is selling just because i havent seen a bunch on the road especially when it may not be a brand style or model that i am particularly interested in    to your other point you are talking about a  sales increase over prior year and what you say is true however the fact that a vehicle recently sold more than just about any other competitor vehicle in its class doesnt have anything to do with last year but i also agree with flightnurse in that the acura is a brand new redesign which has been significantly changed and has a lot of advertising tied to it sales will die down and then one can see how well it does going forward but i stand by my earlier statement that dealers are selling the h out of them but for how long is the question,m6user
3443,June 2012,funny you say that about stalking cars im always giving cool cars the thumbs up out of my sunroof when im driving the prelude sometimes to other bmw drivers when im in my 328    you are right that if they are outselling every key competitor in its class that it has nothing to do with last years sales numbers i must have gotten a post or 2 confused i agree that sales will die down with regards to the new acura  2001 prelude type sh 2015 infiniti q40 awd 2017 honda honda touring awd,nyccarguy
3444,June 2012,considering the acura competitors in the same category most x3audiaudijx have pretty close sales numbers plus a rx that sells 3 times more and being 34 years older most being 5k more expensive    i will say either this statement is highly exaggerated or the sales expectation was pretty low to begin with we might say for the new generation sales has improved and is much better than before    dealers are selling the h out of them,ctl
3445,June 2012,dont quite follow what youre getting at the acura hondaing to sales figures have sold about 3 times more in may this year versus what the 2012 sold last year sales numbers are sales numbers and arent exaggerated unless you have some inside information that the sales numbers are wrong remember last year you were dealing with a fairly unpopularby the general public acura and sales could also have been curtailed by the sunami for a short time as the 2012 model i believe were all built in japan    when you go from almost dead last in a category to almost 1st whatever term you care to use for the increase is correct lets not play sematics,m6user
3446,June 2012,i think the term well said is over done on this board look at last time but nope this was well said look at the sale numbers  its all available for you on the www  same with resid value people for those who have been in dealerships and talked to sales people as you test drive the new turbo d its all in sales numbers not what some dealer is sayig about a brand he is selling amazing we have gotten to this this was pointed out when people were talking about how great the new tl was well it was almost 30 less great then the outgoing model its all about sales  btw the acura is a little off topic,sweendogy

3463,June 2012,sweendogy  i give you a lot of credit for attending various driving schools i also agree with you that if more people not the guys here on the board drove vehicles with manual transmissions that theyd pay more attention to their everyday driving habits i used to heavily criticize many things on these boards many moons ago i think i signed on in 99 from awd to automatic transmissions    automatics were terrible my 1st car was a 1992 chevrolet beretta gt w a 3 speed automatic garbage my 2nd car was a 1998 ford ford sport with a 5 speed automatic that shifted slow  violently    i love my 2001 honda prelude type sh equipped with a slick shifting 5 speed manual transmission i did not appreciate the bill i got to replace the clutch friction plate  throw out bearing at only 52000 miles    my 328xi is an automatic w awd its our 2nd bmw with at  awd 1st was my wifes 2007 x3 manuals have been an 800 or so option for a number of years on the chevrolet yes they are somewhat of a compromise but that margin is getting slimmer  slimmer every year    id like to teach my children 55 3  7 months to drive stick and have their 1st car equipped with a manual transmission    speaking of driver skills i put the brakes to the test on my bmw this morning about 34 mile away from my house im on a straight section of a curvy road i see a acura that took the corners so badly he was heading straight towards me i jumped on the brake pedal there was nowhere to go and those bmw clamped down  stopped immediately this would have not been an offset front end collision this would have been a straight head on collision if i had left 1 second earlier not come to a full  complete stop  the stop sign by my house wow i think at the very least id have been car shopping again or at the worst put bmw crash worthiness to the test makes you think what on gods green earth was this guy doing in my freakin lane  2001 prelude type sh 2015 infiniti q40 awd 2017 honda honda touring awd,nyccarguy

3465,June 2012,nycglad to hear youre ok bmw brakes are excellent as you found out    when my son turned 15 i taught him to drive on a manual transmission not an automatic i still had my track ford at the time and was irregularly taking it to the local track and i took him to midohio for autox myself and a friend set up and drove a toyota fx16 there    did any of it make him a better driver i dont know those first couple of years he actually had more tickets and accidents than i did at the same time in my driving career    and when he got the chance he went for an automatic vs a manual transmission car    the benefit of manual trans if there is one has faded over the years first the manual trans was used because they offered better fuel economy thats simply not true today with rare exceptions    as many of us can testify here including yourself todays automatics are miles away from where they used to be    on the track or the highway theres no way i can shift as quickly as the stronic can i hit the paddle shifters and the shift is firm and immediate    the automanual trans in your bmw it will be in the right gear at the right time and do it quicker than you can    that offers more control over the car not less    the higher up the performance and price ladder you go the fewer and fewer manual transmissions youll see as was pointed out before even ferraris and lambos are now sporting manumatics most would agree that those are at the top of the heap when it comes to personal performance cars    maybe somebody can make another thread to talk about manual transmissions as in here this has become derailed    kdcouldnt agree with you more  2018 acura tchrysler sh awd aspec,graphicguy

3489,July 2012,hey fed which diesel engine does it have    on my flight yesterday from raleighdurham to detroit the guy sitting next to me was a ford engineer who is working on the new ford he is waiting for the green light to bring over a diesel power ford he would like to see the 22l 200hp diesel come over however he thinks ford will choose the the 2l 160hp engine either way it will be good to see ford give volkswagen a run in the family sedan with a diesel he was telling me all about the car i havent spoken to a car engineer that was so excited about a new product before but the mondeo is a 5 door if im not mistaken right so what are your thoughts on the overall car,flightnurse
3490,July 2012,i dont know which diesel it is the engine cover says ford duratorq fwiw  no other info to be found in the car yes its a 5 door    there is some torque to be had between about 1800 and 3500 rpm but nowhere else redline is 4500 if i had to put numbers on the car my seat of the pants guess would be 060 in maybe 11 or 12 secs    steering is light with little feedback but the car tracks beautifully ride is euro firm and compliant  much better than the current ford body roll and rebound are very tightly controlled clutch is light and shifter is effortless with short throws with a smidge of cable notchiness but not in a bad way    the cabin is laid out very well with high quality materials and the cabin is very quiet on the highway  and i do mean quiet the ride is serene with very little wind or road noise and a very rigid chassis with zero flex squeaks and rattles are nonexistent    i havent pushed the car so i cant comment on sporting capabilities but as a touring car it is outstanding,fedlawman
3491,July 2012,i dont know which diesel it is    knowing how rental companies operate here in europe its probably the 18 tdci engine rated at either 100bhp or 125bhp could be the 20 at 115bhp but unlikely to be anything more exotic 060 for that bunch is indeed in the 11 to 12 seconds bracket    the other engines on offer in our mondeo are 20 tdcis with either 140 or 175bhp the latter showing circa 84secs for 060 however 060 dashes are not what diesels are about really economy stressless driving good midrange punch 4070 is usually pretty fair the mondeo is rated highly here in europe and seen as a good and cheaper bmw 3 series competitor without the sporting pretentitions which in the case of the cookingend of the 3 series really are pretentions glad youre enjoying it,alltorque
3492,July 2012,youre right i am noticing that 060 really isnt important here because of the way the roads are designed here  and all the small towns one passes through    the registration paper i found says 1560 cc  dont know if its accurate though yes midrange pull isnt bad and it got above 160 kph with little fuss    my only real complaint is the throttle response which is very lethargic its as though the flywheel weighs 40 lbs im sure its progdodgemed into the flybywire but it makes downshifting more difficult and heelandtoe immpossible its the same effect i notice on many new cars ive driven    other than that a very nice car,fedlawman

3495,July 2012,same old caddy did you read the article it may be the same engine  but correct me if im wrong most cars here have engines recycled within a line even the beloved tl and bmw,sweendogy
3496,July 2012,bill caddy thinks the ats is a 3series fighter the interior room is smaller then the current 3 series the standard engine in the ats only makes 202hp bmw 240hp    this is what caddy says about the ats  20l turbo directinjected fourcylinder 272hp engine providing a 060 time of 57 seconds and 32 mpg highway2 a 6speed automatic transmission is standard    ok the standard 2l turbo in the bmw only makes 240hp but is faster 060 and getting better highway mileage and comes with a 8 speed auto    once again the caddy falls short the 36l 060 is about the same as the turbo 4 in the bmw so the turbo 6 in the bmw is even faster and gets about the same mileage as the turbo 4 caddy not too sure i would be boasting these numbers since caddy says that ats can hold itself up against the 3 series    i laugh that caddy thinks the ats is the same size as the 3 series but it is not the interior volume is less and also caddy thinks the cts competes with the 5 series hardly    btw you can now build a ats    now i wonder how the ats hold up against the infiniti since that is what it should be crossed shopped to,flightnurse
3497,July 2012,no you are not wrong put g on the list too  my point is just another boring entry level car to add to the ever increasing list,billyperksii
3498,July 2012,if you are in the 5s 060 that is fast by any measure so haggling over 12 seconds seems petty and even statistically insignificant and what is the mpg difference 1 mpg    size wise it has almost the identical footprint i thought and some cars feel more or less roomy than the cg rating depending on how they are laid out    at least they offer the v6 most likely for the customers that just wont do a 4 cyl    anyway as this thread proves there is a lot of personal opinion involved with this class of car but from seeing one in person at the auto show and reading about them it sounds like it very much is a strong competitor probably with a little more american flavor and that some people will like it and some wont    but i dont think you can use those few s on paper to say it is a loser entry  2018 hyundai hyundai sport mine and 2013 acura acura awd wifes,stickguy
3499,July 2012,exactly gee the cad has more 30 more hp a little more torque and weighs less than the 3very little so those are huge pluses on its side right i dont think so these very small differences dont mean beanswhichever side has the plus or minus    love it when a brand new car comes out that nobody has driven or even sat in most cases and decide that a few small stats automatically make it a loser pretty close minded dont you think,m6user
3500,July 2012,i did not say the car is a loser i just said boring nothing new under the sun just another participant in this segment    the manufacturers need to take this segment to another level because the nonpremium brands are offering the same features for far less than what the so call premium brands are offering  case in point my dealer wants me to trade up to the advance trim tl his convincing points are cooled seats blind spot indicator crisper nav graphics and 6 speed autoi told him the kia kia offers that for thousand less  with all that said my pride hinders me from purchasing a kia  i will just have to wait until 2014 to see what the next generation tl has to offer,billyperksii
3501,July 2012,if you cant tell the differnece in quality by just sitting in a tl versus sitting in a kia then maybe you should be driving a kia cause you would be satisfied with the cheap leather and the trinkets the steering and suspension may suck on the kia but gotta love that heated steering wheel i miss that soooo much on my carnot    im not really a fan of cadillac or gm for that matter but what is so boring about the new ats it looks like a baby cts and ive never heard the cts described as boring a lot of other things but not boring,m6user
3502,July 2012,good points problem with alot of the anti caddy or anything non bmw or audi posters its all about the germans  they continue to boast about the great bmw any always bash with out any real substance behind it the 1 or 2 mpg difference or the size  come on guys it comes down to pricing value should be considered  thats why consumer reports continues to rank the g its now in its 6th year as the number one car in the class i have not priced this new caddy out but if its priced right it should be considered i love the boring comments  look at the cars on the right  the acura is an honda hello,sweendogy
3503,July 2012,not literally boring just same old same old,billyperksii
3504,July 2012,the way i look at these cars is that they all have their attributes which attract certain types of buyersdriving enthusiusts if you must the germans have great styling that stands the test of time and great suspensions i would have added steering but not so much anymore japanese have great engines cheaper tco and nice bells and whistles the americans have good cars in this field and getting much better imo and are kind of a combo of the germansjapanese regardless of what hyndai kia is doing lately they dont really particpate that well in this field given their crappy suspensions steering and handling in general and cheaperbut flashy ingredients to some handling the curvies is more imporant than straight line power and to others the opposite and then some like a little of both none are wrong and none are absolutely right    i know i forgot volvo but are they swedish or chineseim not sure now i probably missed something else too anyway they all have things that are more important to the individual so to put one down because it doesnt fit into ones personal vision of a great ellps is silly,m6user
3505,July 2012,yeahcadillac has been hyping this car for awhile the biggest issue with them theyve been touting their bmw killers for awhile now until very recently they were anything but    maybe this car changes that perception maybe not    ive driven the cts coupe its a nice effort would i trade my bmw for it nope i dont know what it is cadillac has the sort of feel that doesnt impress me actually all gms have that feel if the cts didnt wow me away from the bmw i doubt the ats will either    that doesnt make it a bad car i think it may sell well but those sales will go to people who wouldnt look at a bmwaudimercedes benz to begin with the ats will most likely capture the buick owner or maybe the chevrolet person maybe thats exactly what gm wants their gateway car chevrolet customers staying in the family moving up buick and finally to their top carscadillacs  2018 acura tchrysler sh awd aspec,graphicguy
3506,July 2012,bmw caddy has building the hype for this car for a while saying that the ats will be able to overtake the 3 series and its build in the us the only engine that was ever talked about was the turbo 4 and how much more power it makes over the bmw as well as price now come to find out there are 3 engines and the starting price is less then the bmw however if you want the turbo 4 the starting price is slight less then the base 3 the performance is less then the bmw and the caddy has a 6 speed auto and the bmw has an 8 speed auto you can only get a manuel in the turbo 4 in the caddy all others is an auto if memory serves me this is a deal breaker for many of you    stick the 335 is more then 5 sec quicker then the v6 ats and the ats has more power also caddy hasnt released the 14 times yet either im suspecting that the bmw will be faster there too    i was hoping for more from the ats since with all its hype that gm has been generating but the performance numbers so far havent been all that good for the kind of hp the car is making,flightnurse
3507,July 2012,graphic all the hype has been taking owners away from bmw that wont happy i have rented a couple of cts sedans and the interior space feels cdodgeped to me more so then a 3 series so not too sure how the ats is going to fare there if the bigger brother is feels smaller then the smaller ats will be smaller,flightnurse
3508,July 2012,bmw i am far from an anti caddy person in fact in the last month i have been trying to sway my partner to go look at the buick buick so far that hasnt been easy to do and he is from detroit    for the past 4 months i have waited for the ats to be released and with more information however the hype i think was greater then what gm could product the first time out look how long it took caddy to get the cts where it is today i like the cts but not too sure how gm can say that the cts is in the same league as an audi 5 series or e class on paper it does but the translation from paper to product didnt happen very well i think the same thing is going to happen with the ats    regarding kia and hyundai the current crop of high end luxury cars is just the start i bet they will get their cars dialed in faster then gm will,flightnurse
3509,July 2012,i seem to recall a number of posters on this thread infering that 060 times werent that important when a certain someone was relating how the infiniti is so much faster 060 than the 3 oh well i guess when it fits ones argument it does matter i could care less about the ats and also dont care if a car is stick or auto but i still say its sad that so called auto enthusiusts are so close minded when a new car comes out and trash it before its even been thoroughly tested or doesnt fit a particular mold its sad really,m6user
3510,July 2012,bmw the name is sweendogy not certain someone the elephant in the room the guy who makes this channel work by posting relevant topics thus causing discussion see above sure people dont agree with me but i dont make up points  before i post i do homework    and i agree the german bias argument is old sad and its rude they make great cars but so do others  plus german cars come at a sizable premium remember this is ellps and if 50k is the new el  i might be going kia soon    the acura is still on the board and hondaing to cd this caddy is a real player,sweendogy
3511,August 2012,but even thou the acura offers a 4 and a 6 does that make it ellps fwd slow no awd option    in the proper hands fwd can perform very well    driving a slow car fast is much more fun than driving a fast car fast    when did awd become a requirement for a vehicle to be a performance sedan,robr2
3512,August 2012,could this just be the big marketing machine making people think that if it doesnt offer a bigger engine then it not a luxury car    the marketing machine has said a 6 is mandatory in this category and have not offered a 4 cylinder option for years they are only doing so now because cafe is forcing them to and imho the vast majority of the customers wont even care as they dont buy cs 3s and audis for performance they buy them to show their neighbors the label on the trunk without having to disclose the low lease payment    further imho a 50k 3 series is not longer an ellps at 50k it better be much more than entry level,robr2

3517,August 2012,well said    everything is up    also as technology marches forward isnt it true that these cars depreciate more rapidly than ever or isnt it true that those who need current technology efficiency and performance will want to refresh their cars more often    doesnt the above if accurate suggest that we consumers might want to take the approach that many companies take which is to elect to have permanent payments on it infrastructure both real and virtual in order to always stay current    car companies rely on a consumer that will refresh his car every 36 months to 39 months  and the most practical way to justify this is to rent cars much in the same way technology is rented or subscribed to    in my office building is my tech firm and a cpa firm the cpa managing partner says you must either lease a new car and resign yourself to permanent monthly payments or buy a car and keep it a minimum of 10years and the 10 year number is the breakeven number    my consultant friend had a 550 bmw and when the lease was up on it he looked at another bimmer and  sit down  a top o the line hyundai at that moment in history the hyundai lease was 299 per month his decision hyundai and his thoughts are if possible to pay 299 per month forever and always have a new or nearly new car    sure you can i did argue that there is no comparison between a 550 and the hyundai well this guy far as i can tell could afford virtually anything without a second thought probably into the low 6figures but the depreciation was taking the fun out of owning so he switched to leasing then even that wasnt much fun anymore especially when he swears he has given up oh so little to have that new hyundai well he has given up the high cost    i dunno maybe its the hangover from the great recession maybe its the phase of the moon  or climate change    the prices keep going up that much is certain    what also is happening is that few companies own airplanes either  they rent them and there is at least some argument that would justify buying a jet  since they are practically rebuilt annually    the glut of cars the economy and people feeling they dont want to drive yesterdays news seems to be pressing us to drive younger and younger cars despite their breathtaking drop in value    ill tell you how crazy this is if you dont think cross shopping a 550 with a hyundai is crazy enough my commercial banker neighbor went from a v12 mercedes benz full sized coupe to a hyundai again not for any lack of ability on his part to front the money    maybe he just didnt want to be considered part of the 1    hell its hot confuse,markcincinnati
3518,August 2012,the cpa managing partner says you must either lease a new car and resign yourself to permanent monthly payments or buy a car and keep it a minimum of 10years and the 10 year number is the breakeven number    really not a very smart cpa imho unless he is looking at leasing from only a business perspective i dont think very many private owners who cannot take advantage of business tax laws would agree with that    i always buy  always have ive never been offered a lease deal that could be better for me than an outright purchase now i used to have a coworker who would always lease because he never wanted to be out of warranty but he was a high mileage driver and insisted on zero down 20k miles per year and an extended warranty to 60k at one time he leased a volkswagen for almost 500 a month and he was fine with that heck he couldve financed the whole thing for maybe 40 a month more and owned it outright,robr2

3520,August 2012,10 years ago when this thread was started the entrylevel segment was defined by the e46 3series acura tl audi audi lexus lexus and the pontiac5 all of them started at or just below 30000    of course back then cars still had cassette players and 060 in 7 secs was considered quick this segment has probably seen the biggest gains in performance and technology over the last decade than any other segment    i suppose that a 10000 average price hike over a ten year period is reasonable when considered logically but emotionally it just seems like an invisible line was crossed 40000 just seems like a lot of money to me for a group of relatively ubiquitous cars,fedlawman
3521,August 2012,top line of ford ford compact economy is over 28k msrp base on a nissanium 5 dr is 245k then add fluff btw the top level ford is the hybrid with starts at 39k    the most expensive brand of ellps or at least one of top 3 goes over 50k    but why why not import a lower cost model instead bmw mb audi will introduce smaller cars to bring the price point down i dont want a 4dr 1 series i dont want a b class or audi sedan    but the truth is today it is hard to find something decent below forty grand    new or used if new and i know some people would disagree but one can build a nice chryslerc for under 40k as well as lexus is    yes prices do go up but there has to be a point when entry is no longer entry is a nissan max an ellps now i think infiniti got it right but for some reason it never took off offer he current g in a price point the infiniti looks just like a infiniti the leather might not be as nice but the instrument panel seats body all look like the big brother but the price is not not too sure why it never caught on a nice way to get into the ellps,flightnurse
3522,August 2012,i dont want a 4dr 1 series i dont want a b class or audi sedan    i do    the current 3series and audi are as big as the 5series and audi of a decade ago a 4door bmw or audi for 32000 is exactly where this segment should be,fedlawman

3524,August 2012,i think the pricecreep is more a result of perspective than actual increase    this week i had the pleasure of purchasing football equipment for 2 boysmy younger boy found gloves he liked but its only 50 dollars    and then i proceededin my day 50 dollars could buy you shades,ivan_99
3525,August 2012,point well taken but i will then ask at what price point these days are there not a group of relatively ubiquitous cars from which one may choose    50000 60000 even 70000 it seems to me that even at the higher price points there are several offerings that for many only differ in styling  and sometimes even then the styling isnt all that much of a differentiator    heres the thing that i noticed the last time i was visiting our bmw dealer  there are bmw 7 series cars that shoot way the hell past 100k yet they are only slightly differentiated from the cheap ones    there was a high zoot audi at the audi dealer and there was also an s8  now i wouldve taken the s8 if i were just thinking about the car itself but the audil w12 with a bunch of i cant believe the thing has a walk in cooler in the back seat type options was way more expensive then of course there was the cheapie plain ol audi swb version they were all very er ubiquitous    now i used to think i was pretty astute at discerning what i was looking at  but today i saw a new volkswagen sel that mustve had some optional glitzy wheels and a beige leather interior i assume it was real cow that is i thought for a full second nice audi    i doubt the volkswagen was more than 35k  but it looked expensive assuming you think audis look expensive    nothing about a acura looks expensive to me  but what the hell do i know i bought a 2012 acura tl not to imply i think the tl looks expensive but from the outside it looks less like a honda than the acura    what do i know    drive it like you live surprise,markcincinnati
3526,August 2012,no the starting price on a bmw rwd 325 in 2003 was about 27k and the starting price of the 2013 bmw rwd 328 is about 36k that is approx 9000 difference and would constitute creep as they say,m6user
3527,August 2012,27k in 2003 is 336k in 2012still creeping a bit i suppose,ivan_99
3528,August 2012,yes i would say so 9k is about a 33 increase in price a 2002 toyota toyota le was 19500 a 2012 toyota le is 23400 about a 20 increase the 2003 audi audi audi was 27500 and the 2013 version is 33400 or about a 21 increase if one could consider the toyota as a commodity and use that as a baseline it would seem bmw ellps has creeped substantially more than both the baseline and one of its main competitors and both the toyota and the audi increased below the percentage you used for inflation,m6user

3531,August 2012,the infiniti looks just like a infiniti the leather might not be as nice but the instrument panel seats body all look like the big brother but the price is not not too sure why it never caught on a nice way to get into the ellps     the leather in the infiniti is the same leather as in the infiniti the only difference between the two is the smaller engine and the unavailability of several options in the infiniti like no nav etc the reason it didnt sell imo is the same reasons i was disappointed in it    1 couldnt get nav or a few other bells and whistles as options even  2 for 100 less horses i believe people thought you should get a lot better mpg on regular gas too  3 it was only priced about 3000 less than the infiniti and they are always discounting the infiniti pretty heavy and wouldnt go down that far on the infiniti net effectthey were too close in price for such a drastic difference in performance,m6user
3532,August 2012,wow you guys have been quite chatty since i last checked in im back in ct after driving 1700 miles through 10 states    i agree with you guys that acura has completely lost its way the tl shawd is the exception here the acura brakes stink our government should mandate that bmw supply brakes to every car on the road    prices on these cars have crept up over the years as you all know my 2011 328xi is leased i know its more expensive to lease but its going to be a damn fun 30 months 50k for a 4 cyl 3 series is a big pill to swallow like many of you have said 50k is not entry level in my book anyway im quite certain that if i do want to continue to drive sedans in this category when the lease is up on my bmw in 2 years im going to have to go the cpo route otherwise ill have to look at a car that isnt so performance oriented to suite my commuting needs  2001 prelude type sh 2015 infiniti q40 awd 2017 honda honda touring awd,nyccarguy
3533,August 2012,the thing with honda and toyota is that that have been trying to follow cadillac and mercedes benz now this isnt a bad thing the c class is a superb car to get around town in in style without breaking the bank gm makes superb big boats that float down the road and are kind on your old back    theres a reason the lexus es is called a japanese buick acura rightly figured that since it couldnt make a better car than the 3 series they should just go where the money is  in big comfy cars fair enough the tl is a very nice car inside and is great to just drive around town and get stuck in traffic in    but toyota and honda are a lot like gm in that theres a hard division between sports and luxury with only one or two vehicles that bridge that gap possibly the lexus is and the cts honda has nothing any more since they dropped the acura,plekto
3534,August 2012,i kind started it but now i have to add one small contradiction to what was said sure cars went up 2030 over ten years this is much more than average wage increase except perhaps the top earners who seem to enjoy way better growth than rest of us in those terms cars should not cost more than 1015 part of the rest could be explained by commodity inflation outpacing the wage inflation especially in late 00s and even now it is not all gone i just cant imagine how much box of corn flakes will cost next year there was a huge dollar debasement in late 00s somewhat recovering now but its a fact if anybody cares to remember 1 euro was about 90 us cents in early 2000s all of those things contributed to price increases and german brands would probably have crept even more if not for economic downturn and loss of the marginal customer one that puts your sales target over the guided targets    however those cars also offer more much more for that money more metal not always a good thing but at least in absolute terms  it is more more features better safety better fuel economy with more power etc some was mandated tire pressure monitors traction control systems gas mileage improvements some was marketdriven consumer electronics size i know some people would actually prefer 2003 325i over 2012 bmw but in all objective metrics 2012 model is simply a better machine same goes for the named toyota audis and all the rest if we factor those improvements the prices are probably not as outrageously higher the models tend to drift up in size and content over the years and create room for new line 3series vs 1series so after about three generations it is fair to start making those comparisons both in term of price and content with models from other shelf i think in 10 years ellps will include all those models dismissed today as not l enough or not p enough and current 3seriescclass will be favorite family upscale sedans surprise  2018 430i gran coupe,dino001
3535,August 2012,i agree about the reason for the price creep but i also see people adapting to that by lowering their standards when it comes to to their next car to keep it simple somebody who used to drive an honda honda will drop down to an ex and then perhaps to an chrysler in the course of a few years as their income hasnt kept up with the price of automobiles  or anything else as well    i know someone who in the course of 5 cars and 15 years who has gone from a chrysler to mitsubishi with a gradual step down over the years in order to keep the payment in his comfort zone,robr2

3537,August 2012,3 it was only priced about 3000 less than the infiniti and they are always discounting the infiniti pretty heavy and wouldnt go down that far on the infiniti net effectthey were too close in price for such a drastic difference in performance    im thinking this is the real issue i went over to the infiniti leasing questions forum and was shocked at how much infiniti is discounting the cars also the odd length of the leases 18 months many people are getting leases on a infinitis 6 spd mt for just fees and 299m other have been able to get a infiniti dodge  premium package drive off are fees and 405m this is with tax for 36 months infiniti is giving some incredible buy rates to get these prices    one can see why the infiniti did not sell but i did read that it will be coming back with a turbo 4 and more equipment for the same price should be interesting,flightnurse
3538,August 2012,after just a little research i found it interesting to note the following price increases over a ten year period for several base ellps    1 bmw  33  2 audi  21  3 mb  14    quite a spread and dont know how it is explained by commodity prices and euro exchange rate as the latter would affect all the german makers somewhat equally    now content could explain away some of the large difference in price creep but i believe all the makers have increased size and content to similar degrees comparatively and with the recent improvements in the c class it seems like that may be a value if you like mb,m6user

3540,August 2012,is there a big gap between a 40k car vs a 50k car i guess it depends on the car and the measuring stick is it performance quality of build andor materials used suspension sophistication features    if you use the acura tl sh awd as the baseline at 40k is it as good or better than a bmw bmw an audi as4 probably not i would say it trumps a mercedes benz c class 4 matic though it has better tech and suspension than a g    the 3 series is the measuring stick if you get all the tech with leather nav power bmw etc youre going to pay 50k as hard as it is for me to say the s4 trumps the bmw bmw too so to get that extra nth degree more of everything you pay more    having driven the tl sh awd the g and comparing them to the bmw and the s4 you can immediately see where the extra money went    its up to the individual with the check book to decide if its worth it  2018 acura tchrysler sh awd aspec,graphicguy

3585,August 2012,thats a good deal  but it also reminds me that i need to collect my finders fee from my friend that i referred to bmw of towson they had a brand new not demo bmw 6speed manual sport package etc etc with a sticker of 60000 they had it listed on their website as a special for several months at 50900 i told him to hand them a check for 45k and dare them to rip it up they did the deal in late june at 45500    unfortunately towson didnt have any remaining allocations for build to order 2012 x5ds so i had to order ours from another dealer but the sales manager was pretty good natured about it  said i can always come in and buy something from their sister porsche dealer at 5000 over msrp to make up for the loss they took on my hardball friend    reaffirms my belief that there are always good deals out there if you are willing to shop around,habitat1

3591,August 2012,yup thats usually how it is    buti dont think you need to or should go as far as to settle for your third or worse choice of color and options if you plan ahead and are willing to do the other three things    acura makes it easy limited trim choices and color choices with almost no options to begin with find a dealer with a big inventory that has great deals other brands with long option lists are a little tougher but my recent experience with bmw proved to me that custom ordering from a dealer  which i always assumed meant paying a higher price than taking a car off the lot  may in fact produce the best results long term we had to shop around to a dozen or more dealers to find one that still had allocation spots for a 2012 x5d but in the end found one willing to negotiate a price that was within a few hundred compared to invoice of the best deal we could have gotten for a leftover vehicle on the lot but by ordering to our exact specs we also didnt get stuck with a few options we didnt want which ended up putting us ahead in the end    if and when i get another fun car i will in all likelihood order a porsche rather than take one of the lot trying to find my color and option preferences given the ridiculous list of choices from porsche is a near fruitless exercise and id rather shop around for a dealer willing to give me a 67 discount on a custom order than compromise my preferences to take a car off the lot like i did in 2005 at a 11 discount but one that had a lot of options that i didnt want and didnt have a couple that i now know i would like    a friend of mine who used to work for audi corporate not dealer indicated that even though audi is achieving record sales and many dealerships are low on inventory you can still order one at or below invoice due to incentives and their desire to continue to increase sales vs bmw and mercedes benz    there is a saying in my business real estate development that a great deal on a fair property is not as good as a fair deal on a great property for my friend that got lucky with a bmw manual transmission he got the best of both worlds but for most of us i think id rather shop really hard for the car i wanted and not be stuck with my third or fourth choice color and the wrong options for the next 678 years,habitat1

3595,August 2012,being able to wait should eliminate the settling issue    the internet makes it real easy to shop around in a fe minutes i found the dealer that seems to be hoarding all the ones we want first choice color and interior they have 3 no one else seems to have any but they are about 2 hours away    so my choice now is take a ride or just wait for a local dealer to get one    of course the far away guy is also way lower on price  2018 hyundai hyundai sport mine and 2013 acura acura awd wifes,stickguy
3596,August 2012,what i meant was that in order to achieve respectable epa highway ratings for the chevrolet gm made the final two i believe gear ratios so tall that they are effectively idling at 65 mph and dont play any part in the use of the car as a sports car  ie what you basically have is a 4speed manual with 2 overdrive gears and that for a variety of reasons just doesnt appeal to me as something i would ever claim was great engineering at least when porsche decides to add a tall highway ratio like they did this year they put it in as a 7th speed and leave the first 6 as before and perfectly matched to the engine output    i dont want to turn this into a gm bashing string but heres what i see when i look at precision engineering    z06 chevrolet vs 911s  70 liters vs 38 liters  505 hp vs 400 hp  470 ftlbs vs 325 ftlbs  1524 epa vs 1827 epa  slower vs faster acceleration to 60100  slower vs faster around the ring  higher vs lower top speed in 4th vs 6th  76000 vs 96000    you can essentially do the same comparison for the zsubaru vs 911 turbo    i dont dispute that the chevrolet is a lot of raw performance for the money i just think that it appeals to those that prefer raw to refined everything is done by increasing the quantity  engine size tire size etc and they still fall short of the 911 on everything that matters to me for a nimble handling high performance sports car the fact that a 911s or turbo costs 2030k more than the comparable chevrolet model may make them expensive to some but id rather have the cheap 911s than the 15k more expensive zsubaru any day im not going to be too disappointed that i am a few tenths slower in the quarter mile or a few mph short in top speed at least i will have a car engineered to get the absolute most out of less and is screwed together very well something that i am also going to consider when i cast my presidential vote this fall,habitat1
3597,August 2012,no thanks and no offense but the chevrolet is in many ways for me the epitome of gms screwed up engineering     sounds like a ringing endorcement for the brand to me    while i agree the higher expensive priced 911 is a better all around car its still considerably more expensive    couple of questions i see you used a select use of comparion data why the select group ie no 060 other question is the  around expensive whats that supposed to mean a 25 premium wo options from one car to the other when comparing such cars seems regular no  expensive to me,sweendogy
3598,August 2012,i was making reference to 060 in my faster acceleration to 60 and on up to 100 i know you are a stickler for hard data but to be honest im going off of memory of comparison tests by rt cd etc whereby the chevrolet had considerably difficulty starting from a standstill without spinning its wheels i do know the new 911s has been independently tested at 37 seconds to 60 but would have to do some research to get a reference same is true for the turbo which at 28 was the second fastest 01 behind the veyron ever tested not that any of this matters to me personally anything under about 45 is more than i need or care to pay for    which brings me to the expensive quotes i respect that for some people 75k is expensive and for others 135k isnt so much so compared to the 2 million plane they are eyeballing i am a heck of a lot closer to the former than the latter but for me a 96k 911s the cheaper porsche would be far more rewarding to drive and own than the 110k zsubaru most expensive chevrolet hell knock the s off the 911 and save another 12k and it wouldnt change my mind    i just dont find the gm engineering of the chevrolet is particularly inspiring or compelling not that im a german snob and dont think the us is capable of it  in fact i have a deposit on a tesla model s and may very well be driving my first american car in 25 years by next february,habitat1

3600,September 2012,the interesting thing about the vette v 911 is the person who is shopping a vette isnt shopping for a 911 they are completely different cars the vette rings america big v8 baritone exhaust tone flat torque curve now while the vette is idling at 65 the car does pick up speed nicely while in 6th gear    your argument is interesting however one needs to remember when cruising along the highway why does the car need to be revving at 3k the owner just has to go down to 3rd gear and be gone not a hard thing to do    price a base model vette can be had for 45k while the base price 911 is 86k not too sure if the extra money is worth the extra performance,flightnurse
3601,September 2012,what is a short period of time  the pontiac537 is now in its 10th year and 2 generations im sure we will see a hike in price but dont you think infiniti knows its main draw is similar performance at a cheaper price i mean its been doing it right for 10 plus years,sweendogy
3602,September 2012,infiniti can only be based as a value buy for a short time    why no car will ever be exactly the same as a bmw or any other brand for that matter as they all have their little differences infiniti has chosen a path to be similar to a bmw but also different and in some categories better and for a little less money seems to work for them so why do you say they can only do it for a short time i dont try to come off as a marketing genius like some people but thats like saying bmw can only price a 3 series up to mid 50s for a short time because it costs too much silly    just because something is priced a few thousand less does not make it any less of luxury car if the car itself deserves to be in luxury class because of its trimmings equipment quality and dealer experiencethen it is,m6user
3603,September 2012,robbiei agree with your assessments i dont know that cadillac can shake its value luxury image no matter what they do    fni see what youre saying but i think it stems from the fact that both infiniti and acura were at least at their inception marketed as bmwmercedes benzaudi competitors whether it was ever true i really dont know i know the legend was at one time king of the sportlux hill lexus always chose the roll of a better buickcadillac the infiniti m has tried mostly in vain to compete with the e series 5 series audi it never really crossed that barrier the g got close to the bmw3 but never quite got there now infiniti seems to have fallen even farther behind    but i cant tell if this is a temporary thing for infiniti or for acura for that matter well see as both the rltchrysler and the g are due for major redos hard to tell where theyll fall with those vehicles  2018 acura tchrysler sh awd aspec,graphicguy

3605,September 2012,sweeny if you think infiniti is happy with second place think twice infiniti has always been in second place with the competition getting better and better and for less money or the same as infiniti why would anyone want to get a car that is always in second place,flightnurse
3606,September 2012,sweeny over on the infiniti board here on edmonds the pricelease payments for the infinitis are crazy low 18 month lease with 1800 out of pocket and payments of 280m tax that is a steal so if infiniti is selling a lof of them it is because of these insanely low prices their money factor must be next to none thing this indicator only shows that people are looking for a great deal and are happy with the infiniti i wonder if bmw did the same thing how many cars they would move,flightnurse
3607,September 2012,never said they were happy  but i do know that the infinti brand for nissan is a pimple on the azz of cars they sell bread and butter car is the nissan tey have done a godoy job being a second place option to the mighty 3 they sell a boatload of second place cars so for you to say they are always in second might be the case  but again where is the slippage     why would anyone buy a second place car well its a better value and has proven itself over the past 10 years,sweendogy
3608,September 2012,on cheap leasing infiniti is just a carbon copy of what bmw has done for years dont have the exact number but its well over 50 of 3s are leased they also have good residual value and lets not forget the maintence scam  so bmw has been doing the same thing for years guess you hadnt noticed the amound of 45k cars rolling on the lie during the mini recession of 072010,sweendogy
3609,September 2012,i dont think anybody knowingly buys a car that is in second place for what their priorities are    i would agree that if you compare certain driving dynamics of the infiniti vs the bmw you will conclude that bmw has the edge but do the same thing for a fwd or even awd automatic tl and you come to the same conclusion just as quickly price point features maintenance costs etc all come into play and  hopefully  one has the good sense to buy what they believe is the right combination for them    the problem would be if infiniti priced the infiniti exactly the same as a bmw offered exactly the same features and options marketed the car as a direct competitor to the bmw but fell short on driving dynamics i dont think thats the case here    personally i think the bmw would fall into second place if i was buying a sedan today at a price that is at or above 55k for a well optioned performance model it is way too close to the 65k that i could buy an naturally aspirated 8400 rpm bmw at no comparison on driving dynamics period but thats my value judgement and someone elses is likely to be different,habitat1
3610,September 2012,bmw  already 3rd place behind mb and audi ime mebbe 4th behind infiniti if price is considered in front of lexus though,wireless
3611,September 2012,again i respect your subjective assessment based upon your prioritiespreferences i cant imagine anyone objectively giving mercedes benz or audi a higher objective mark than the bmw in driving dynamics assuming you are comparing to a rwd manual transmission sport package bmw but obviously a lot of people buy mercedes benz and audi based upon other preferences and priorities    even when i bought my 2004 tl 6speed i was willing to compromise on driving dynamics to save 10k get more space a little better foul weather traction and the acura reliabilitylower cost maintenance peace of mind i would not make that same choice today different time different circumstances different priorities thats not to say i didnt make my first choice in 2004 correctly just that i would make a different one today,habitat1
3612,September 2012,i cant imagine anyone objectively giving mercedes benz or audi a higher objective mark than the bmw in driving dynamics     i didnt read into his statement that driving dynamics was the only consideration this topic ellps is not just for people looking to drive like mario andretti the 1 of the time they get the chance people look at these vehicles for many different reasons so just because a car is 1 in driving dynamics does not make it the best car in this class to some it may but others may put long term relaiblility and less frequent and expensive repairs at the top of their priority list lots of different folks in this category and not just those that want to drive a car to its absolute limits if one never drives a car to its absolute limits than that factor becomes much less of a consideration,m6user
3613,September 2012,personally i think the bmw would fall into second place if i was buying a sedan today at a price that is at or above 55k for a well optioned performance model it is way too close to the 65k that i could buy an naturally aspirated 8400 rpm bmw at    i think your line of thinking is completely different than many people who buy in this category there are a lot of people out there who lease i also believe there are a lot of people out there who lease and do not understand leasing you say that 55k  is too much for a bmw  youd rather have an bmw for not too much more i think there are a lot of aspiring aspiring ellps buyerslessors who put money down on leases and say you know for another x down and just y per month more i could be driving a bmw instead of a bmw  2001 prelude type sh 2015 infiniti q40 awd 2017 honda honda touring awd,nyccarguy
3614,September 2012,to say that one manufacturer is better than another because of the current lease terms or current incentives is not right every manufacturer in this segment has some kind of different incentive every month to move metal we all know how they do it    bmw subsidizes their leases with high residual values hondaing to bmwfs after 30 months my 2011 328xi will be worth 26406 with 50k on the odometer my car is going straight to auction and they will loose their shirt the car will be 3 model years old with the 2015s coming out not too long after that so almost 4 and the old body style    infiniti uses low money factors    mercedes benzmercedes benz uses conquest cash    acura uses loyalty cash  low apr if you follow the prices paid or lease questions of any particular makemodel it is apparent    ill be the 1st one to admit that my 2011 e90 328xi lease is a splurge for me if it wasnt for the generous incentives 2500 cash sixty something percent residual value after 30 months bmwfs makes 1st 2 payments up to 500 each offered by bmwfs in march 2012 on leftover 2011 models id still be driving my 2010 acura acura  2001 prelude type sh 2015 infiniti q40 awd 2017 honda honda touring awd,nyccarguy
3615,September 2012,i think you are right about the lease vs buy tending to cloud or change the value analysis i always buy and pay with cash keeps me from overspending and  especially when i had my 911 fun car  feeling guilty that i had payments due in january february and march with the car sitting in my garage    lease equations can lead to different results when we just bought our x5d i couldnt see paying 1500 for the premium sound package given what i thought was nominal benefit but if it had worked out to only 10 extra per month for 36 months due to the way bmw makes the numbers work maybe i would figured what the hell and checked the box,habitat1
3616,September 2012,i think the majority of us here on the ellps board do not represent the typical buyer were enthusiasts many of us would take a stick even if it meant giving up a few 10ths to 60  a few mpg on the hwy if it werent for our wives  we shop for the car we like to drive rather than wear    there are people out there who have the mindset that a car payment is like another monthly bill they like the smell of a new car every 23 years if they are going to pay 500 a month on a 60 month loan for a loaded camcord then they might as well pay 600 a month im just throwing this number out there for a 45  50k bmw on a lease  2001 prelude type sh 2015 infiniti q40 awd 2017 honda honda touring awd,nyccarguy

3618,September 2012,why would people buy a second place car for one they can not afford the 1 car and to these people they are ok with second place example my rick he is very happy with his hyundai people dont usually give it a second look which is fine with him however it has more standard feature then a 5 series and a mb e class or audi audi for the same price as a base bmw,flightnurse
3619,September 2012,so for rick the hyundai came in first place when he overlayed his price vs attribute  ie value priorities    it bugs me a bit when i see car magazines do a comparison of cars and mix subjective value factors into determining a winner just give me the objective facts about the cars ill figure out whether performance vs luxury options vs warranty vs aesthetics determines the winner for me and respect the fact that that might be different for the next guy that doesnt mean one of us bought a loser ,habitat1

3625,September 2012,so for rick the hyundai came in first place when he overlayed his price vs attribute  ie value priorities    good point and is exactly what i was saying previously the bmw may be 1 in a couple of categories which is most important to some ellps buyers to many other ellps buyers the value equation may be more important long term reliability and repair frequency and cost are very important to me as i buy cars for cash and keep them for at least 6 years some longer i want a peppy luxurious smaller car that i dont have to have repaired frequently once the warranty is goneor before for that matter and i like a nice handling car but i dont need one that i can zip around the clovernissan at 70mph50 is fine thank you    so bmw can be 1 for some people but for many it is much farther down the list for a number of valid reasons nobody is arguing that it is not 1 in cutting corners so to say a certain car is loser or always 2 is ridiculous as it is 1 to the thousands that buy it and to also say that those same people cannot afford another few thousand dollars more is elitist to say the least and condescending at best,m6user

3629,September 2012,i agree there are far more qualitative differences to performance and handling than raw numbers can represent    should have clarified that what i dont care for is the pricevalue element of the rankings im ok with subjective rankings that would say steering feel is a 10 on a 911 and a 3 on a buick i just dont want to see the buick ranked 1st after price consideration    some of th magazines separate this adjustment out so you can disregard it others build it into their selection of a winner that i think is highly subjective and inaccurate at best unethical at worst if they are vying for advertising dollars,habitat1

3635,October 2012,ive owned mercedes benz toyota volvos before ford ruined them and quite a few other cars and the cts is really bolted together and built like the best cars you can get from japan    gm basically stole engineers from bmw and mercedes benz so when the engine is built in germany well it really is built by the best engineers its fantastic and bmw are also fantastic when it comes to the engines and drivetrains    but the rest of the car is problematic i can drive a 2 year old bmw and the interior is already suffering and the fiddly bits and switches and so on are showing their age rather rapidly bmw apparently spends everything on how it drives and the rest of it is simply put together like a kia gm actually has at least this part downpat their interiors are excellent and in fact often outlast toyota and honda the rest of their cars in the past was crap but the interiors were great    now they have a good platform and a good interior and it wont start crumbling on you at 50 or 80k you can just look at the first generation cts for examples of this and they arent as well built as the 2nd generation    you can laugh all the way to the poor house as youre either leasing forever or paying outrageous repair bills for the most silly things    the ats it really needs a little more time to decide if its a great car or not but so far for a first year model that it got that close to a 3 series and its not going to suffer from bmwitis as it ages bmw days are numbered at this rate if gm of all companies can make them sweat,plekto

3638,October 2012,i dont know if we live in perpendicular universes but you are describing a gm with which i am completely unmazdar my brother in law  a good hard working union contractor  is professionally prohibited from owning anything other than an american car he has been through the entire line up of gm premium products and after a couple of iron cities would admit envy to be able to buy anything german just once before he punches out that final time card and goes to the union hall in the sky his experience with cadillac cadillacs has been particularly painful and frustrating    his chevrolet was also a conundrum of the best of things the worst of things horsepower out the wazu but the interior was almost unbelievable the steering wheel looked like it came out of a chevrolet the seats were beyond atrocious with minimal lateral support road and track recently commented that after complaining about the chevrolet seats for decades they decided to improve them themselves by replacing them with milk crates how the chevrolet can be gms showpiece and have an interior that look like it was put together by a committee of blind fools is beyond me when i had my 911 and invited my brother in law for a ride he refused to get out the union card was dangerously close to being shredded    gm does make some cheap cars so if you like them and they keep you out of the poorhouse good for you my strategy has been to buy quality and keep my cars for 810 years i have no regrets,habitat1

3641,October 2012,markgood summation i loved reading bob lutzs book about his days with gm it was quote eye opening and gave a very clear view why gm had the poor reputation that theyve endured over the last few decades cant believe i just said decades but there it is    they never really set out to build better cars they set out to just build ones that they coule drive out costin engineering materials build etc the result is what we see today they keep claiming theyre getting better but its hard to see where that is the case and it wont be until they change their culture    since the ats was brought up here look at what the trade rags say about cadillacs cue system yescadillac can say they have tech like the other manufacturers but its so poorly implemented that its rendered practically unusable    this attitude vs the japanese or german manufacturers is what denigrates us car companies the most although most ford vehicles ive been in for rentals seem quite competitive    gm cant hit the bmw or audi in handling without making the ride harsh same can be said for infiniti acura seems to do a decent job once you understand youre going to suffer some torque steer with fwd bias    audi and bmw spend money to use better materials for their suspensions it shows when you drive one even the cadillac cts i drove again as a rental as good is it purported to be couldnt match the solidity of my bmw doors when they shut and this was a cadillac with less than 3k miles on it    hellbmw actually has a dept that studies and chooses the most pleasant bellsbuzzes to use when a door is ajar think gm would spend money for that    i havent driven a lincoln in a long time so i dont know how they compare the last chrysler i drove previous gen wasnt all that impressiveespecially from a build and material quality perspective    how long with my bmw last or my gfs s4 i really dont know the bmw is only coming up on its 2 year birthday its as solid now and probably performs better than the day it came off the dealers lot the s4 seems to be in the same category    only time will tell    as mark says as good as the tl sh awd is she wasnt the marrying type  2018 acura tchrysler sh awd aspec,graphicguy

3654,October 2012,guess what i dont think infiniti is trying to clone a bmw 3    ill have to disagree with you on this here is what road and track wrote in the first paragraph of their articlecomparison of the ats and 3 series    the bmw 3 series isnt just a car as my cohort jonny lieberman likes to say the 3 series is a segment now this isnt an attempt to stoke bmw ego or as many of our readers would assume bias towards the bavarian brand its just the simple truth when an automaker chooses to compete in the luxury sports sedan segment its benchmarking the 3 series no bmw has consistently won motor trend comparison tests like the 3 series has and for good reason the 3 series has come to define bmw ultimate driving machine mantra and embodies the purest qualities bmw stands for as a brand    rt said it best if you are going to build a sport sedan than you are going to be compared to a 3 series i do not remember reading that infiniti was not trying to build their version of a 3 series    we all know that over the years the 3 series hasnt lived up to its reputation however it continues to be picked over the others first cd and now rt have picked the 3 series as a winner as i stated before if gm can fix the short comings of the ats they have the best shot of taking the win from bmw,flightnurse
3655,October 2012,cant say that i am shocked by the disagreement you just dont get it i already mentioned that infiniti was benchmarking the 3 and that it was a compliment to bmw benchmarking is not necessarily an attempt to copy but to strive for similarnot exactly the same results nobody is saying any car is overall better than the 3 in this segment just saying there are viable competitors that may be better for some people that dont need the epitome of driving dynamics and care more about other things if infiniti was trying to clone a 328 which is what it was price competitive with they could have given it 240hp instead of 325hp and called it a day they chose a different route does a car have to be a clone of something else to compete in this category not everyone wants a bmwplain and simple i just wrote a check for 40k for a new acura i could just have well written one for a bmw or even more but i really dont want one i have nothing against bmwits the owners that are obnoxious sometimes    i do not remember reading that infiniti was not trying to build their version of a 3 series    kind of hard to prove a negative now isnt it do you also not remember them saying they were,m6user

3659,October 2012,andres i had a 98 audi and i kept it for 88k miles it wasnt a disaster but it wasnt fabulous either the radio volume acted up the sunroof track cracked and was replaced under warranty the worst problem was the cooling problem where the temp would start moving way up while climbing hills on a hot day many visits to the dealer on my dime while they tried the fan clutch the thermostat the radiator etc over 1k on repairs and still not really fixed    yet i loved that car for its interior and its driving i now own an 05 tl and yet i still miss the audi but let me tell you that at 128k on the tl my only repairs were a oat temp sensor recall and replacing a couple of door handle trims that fell off oh and the right window regulator sometimes sticks thats it so i wouldnt call your audi experience all that good certainly not against the best of the japanese brands    but i totally get the commitment to the german cars when i own german i wish i had japanese reliability when i own japanese i miss the german experience    sigh,tlong
3660,October 2012,maybe the auto crisis during the recession turned gm around once and for all maybe the new cadillacs really are world class cars with world class build materials and performance only time will tell but given past history its not like we havent heard this story before    at the end of the day both management and the uaw have to cooperate if not you end up with more pontiacs than ctss    personally im anxious to see the new tl ifwhen it is released the news that trickles out seems to point to a gaselectric built for performance    until then were really enjoying our german rides    speaking of jagsmy sister has an stype that has to be close to 10 years old not a single blip shes looking at replacing it with an xf  2018 acura tchrysler sh awd aspec,graphicguy
3661,November 2012,george foreman fryer with greaseblock technology    the 2013 honda may have all of those extra goodies but im still betting that after i got behind the wheel id still claim my 2002 honda s2000 was the best car honda ever built under the honda label manual seats no tilt telescoping steering wheel a standard two speaker stereo with about 12 watts but when you pushed the start button and started driving it none of that other stuff mattered    dont fall into the trap that thinking dodads are what makes a car great 278 horsepower to the front wheels and a weight balance that is still at least 60 nose heavy isnt going to get me all worked up over the new honda even if that standard george foreman fryer has a self cleaning function    in fairness the new honda may be the best fwd mid size midpriced family sedan on the market and congratulations to honda for bringing upscale technology and safety to the mass market but what i think needs to trickle up to acura is a new attitude i said it 5 years ago and its more true today acura could use honda engineering technology to build a couple of rwd 3 and 5 series competitors with class leading driving dynamics    sorry im just grumpy because im about to dish out 75k for a new boxster s or preowned 911 partly because acura is too friggin boring to put out a 50k s3000 a decade after honda showed they could kick nonpermissible content removed with a 32k s2000 ive been hoping for some trickle up for a long time guess its time to face the fact that its probably not going to happen for my little niche,habitat1
3662,November 2012,grumpy  you are obviously not honda target audience with the fwd honda i mean 75k for a boxer or used 911 wow last month you talked about the tesla you had on order maybe you should just wait for the nsx  its an acura,sweendogy
3663,November 2012,id still claim my 2002 honda s2000 was the best car honda ever built under the honda label    really i have to vote the nsx as the best honda car ever built under the honda label    im just grumpy because im about to dish out 75k for a new boxster s or preowned 911 partly because    what happened to the tesla also how does someone cross shop a boxster s 911 and tesla,flightnurse

3666,November 2012,really i have to vote the nsx as the best honda car ever built under the honda label    i suspect your vote is being cast from a distance that is pretty far away from the drivers seat of that car i considered a pristine preowned 1996 nsx at the time i bought my new 2002 s2000 the 32k 240 horsepower s2000 equalled or exceeded the performance of the 270 hp nsx comparable acceleration handling edge to the lighter tighter s2000 the nsx had more prestige but not more sports car guts or build quality not to mention that the nsx with 30k miles was 49k used and had been 85k new granted the second generation nsx upped the performance slightly with the 290hp 32 liter engine but the price of the nsx was never a remotely good sports car bang for the buck on the other hand the s2000 kicked the butt of everything within 50 of its price base boxster z34 slk nissan etc perhaps not in high torque raw muscle car acceleration or luxury dodads but in extraordinary engineering and visceral sports car performance and handling ill repeat that i think it was the best car to ever wear a hondaacura label    what happened to the tesla also how does someone cross shop a boxster s 911 and tesla    i like the because i can response but then again why not same general price and with the model s performance edition it scoots 0 to 60 in 39 seconds plus i like the green concept even if i dont think human farting was responsible for manhatten being under a mile of ice 16000 years ago but alas after a test drive two weeks ago ive just about crossed the tesla off my list the interior layout and material quality was too much like a high tech volkswagen cart then a high tech luxury performance sedan im going to get back over for another drive with my wife before i decide whether or not to ask for our deposit back but as of right now i told the electrician to hold off extending the 220 chevrolet service in my garage the damn plug is in the rear of the car,habitat1

3668,November 2012,im probably not honda target market for a fwd honda now but it wasnt that long ago that i might have been after all i still drive a 2004 fwd tl 6speed as my everyday car my trickle up comments were more to question why acura hasnt set itself more apart from honda lexus has v8s and rwd infiniti is pretty far removed from the nissan lineup but acura much as i like the parent company hasnt really done much that isnt more than a moderate uptick from honda  other than putting shawd in this and that    as for the new nsx as my baseball managercoach tells me im not getting any younger im having a tough time waiting for the new cayman to be unveiled at the la auto show in 4 weeks by the time seinfeld and all of the other celebrities get the first batch of nsxs i may be ready for one of those motorized chairs they advertise on late night tv besides havent seen the details but i have this stinking feeling that acura is only going to offer some kind of computer aided automatic transmission on the nsx that  and about 300000  are what keeps me from considering the new ferraris as long as im not in a wheelchair i want to use my left foot to depress a real clutch pedal kind of hard to do that on a tesla given that its only one gear but everything else ill shift my own thank you,habitat1
3669,November 2012,the s2000 and nsx are not in the same league while the s2000 handles well for the price of admission not once in all of the years did i read any auto enthusiast magazine compare the s2000 and nsx together as you pointed out the s2000 was fighting with the likes of z3z4 boxster z350370 crowd while the nsx was battling with ferrari lambos and such since the nsx was honda flagship sports car im not too sure that the s2000 could be honda best built car now for you maybe but that statement would be hard pressed to hold itself in a larger automotive community,flightnurse
3670,November 2012,im not getting any younger im having a tough time waiting for the new cayman to be unveiled at the la auto show in 4 weeks    if my travel plans stay how they are i should be in la for the auto show and plan on being there on dec 1st    the next generation nsx doesnt do anything for me i like the last generation simple and straight forward,flightnurse
3671,November 2012,i like the because i can response but then again why not same general price and with the model s performance edition it scoots 0 to 60 in 39 seconds plus i like the green concept even if i dont think human farting was responsible for manhatten being under a mile of ice 16000 years ago but alas after a test drive two weeks ago ive just about crossed the tesla off my list    the problem is that the car is a halfbaked attempt at an electric vehicle they took a readymade car the lotus elise which is a horrendously expensive platform to use and then added a thousand pounds of weight to it in batteries    the nissan on the other hand is a purposebuilt ev and while it needs refinement and work is actually pretty good for a first serious attempt at a ev by a major auto maker yes i know other cars existed in the past but this one you can actually buy and not lease and its not designed with government regulations and making some lawyers happy its designed to actually be a proper vehicle in the marketplace    they did make the s2000 until 2009 so you might actually get a very lightly used s2000    as for new the scion frs coupe is actually quite compelling its inexpensive has a good engine and drivetrain layout and just begs for a superdodge to be added my local dealer had brochures for local trd suppliersshops in the showroom and was saying that it would be 6 months tops before they were able to do it inhouse    independent shops are reporting yields in the 280320hp range which would turn it into a european car crusher much like the nsx was    yes its not honda but its not a bad second choice if you need fas fun and new though id still take a s2000 in a heartbeat,plekto
3672,November 2012,it sounds like the factory will probably take care of the turbo for you within a year or so    one of this months car magazines had a piece on the turbo version of that engine and certainly speculated that this car would get it along with the subaru etc    i think it already has a nice balance of power cost complexity or lack of as it is and is more than fast enough but i am sure that they will make a boatload of money selling a turbo model for what another 3k or so  2018 hyundai hyundai sport mine and 2013 acura acura awd wifes,stickguy
3673,November 2012,not once in all of the years did i read any auto enthusiast magazine compare the s2000 and nsx together    but i did that comparison with my own butt in the drivers seat and had my own checkbook out 1996 nsx 30k miles vs new 2002 s2000 they were a hell of a lot closer than you might be fooled into thinking from simply reading road and track and not doing the comparison yourself    both the nsx and s2000 were hand built side by side at the same japanese factory both had fit and finish were far superior to anything made by honda or acura in the us both were engineered by the same team of honda formula one racing team engineers the nsx produced 90 hpliter without turbos great for its time in 1990 they improved it to 91 hp  liter a little later the s2000 produced 120 hp  liter in 2000 you need a 140k 911 gt3 rs to approach that output today 12 years later the bmw bmw 104 hp liter halfway between the nsx and s2000    the bottom line is that the 1996 nsx i almost bought had a price tag of 85000 new 15000 more than the 1996 911 c2 but by 2002 even a new nsx was no where near the same performance league as a ferrari 360 or cheaper 911s yet at under 35k for the entire 10 year run of the s2000 nothing within 1020k of its price could match its engineering build quality or overall performance im not saying that the nsx wasnt a very good car during its early years but way before the end of its run it had become a underpowered overpriced stale car and sold a few dozen the last couple of years before acura finally and mercifully pulled the plug the s2000 never suffered that level of competitive deterioration or indignation it came in a winner went out a winner vis a vis its competition    some people  perhaps you  don want to give the s2000 credit because it didnt cost 50k or carry the same exclusivenessprestige i look at it differently acura had a marginally competitive car in the 85k price range its biggest advantage when it was introduced was that it didnt break porsche fixed their reliability issues acura sat on its hands relative to keeping the nsx performance competitive honda had a sub 35k car that was the class leader by a big margin for a decade straight that gets my vote you can place yours on the nsx,habitat1
3674,November 2012,was 2002 the first year my bil got one when they first came out he had the first one in central ny and i imagine one of the earliest ones int eh country and he still has it not sure of the miles but i doubt he broke 35k on it babied toy spends winters in the garage probably has not seen rain in years i wish my life was that good    my other bil and i are both waiting for him to get stupid and sell it so we can fight over it and i know now he cant afford it he sometimes gets antsy to buy a porsche older turbo 9xx of some vintage or a cobra kit car but so far he has not pulled the trigger and if he does the s2000 has to go    i drove it when new fun car  2018 hyundai hyundai sport mine and 2013 acura acura awd wifes,stickguy
3675,November 2012,not to dis your reminiscing of the daysgoneby visavis the s2000 because i actually considered one until the kids started coming but didnt the mazda mazda win mostall comparisons    mazda was japanese built as well i didnt delve into the finer details regarding their build quality    the mazda had other problems regarding ownership muscle car mileage with econocar torque    i just didnt see the s2000 as that fantastic maybe i should have tracked one for the day shades,ivan_99
3676,November 2012,stickguy  s2000 came out in late 1999 as a my 2000 the years to own were 2002 and 2003 imo for 2002 they added glass vs plastic rear window stronger clutch  transmission and a few other upgrades but in 2004 they replaced the 9000 rpm 20 liter engine with a 8000 rpm redline 22 liter engine same horsepower slightly more low end torque but it lost a little of the high rpm edge that made it a fan favorite schumacher once commented that its the closest thing under 100000 to a ferrari in spirit    ivan  the mazda never did anything for me a couple of rungs down the ladder in performance funky 4 door with mini back seat it certainly didnt have any success on the track like the s2000 enjoyed about the only thing it had going for it was the novelty of a high rpm rotary engine but given the lower performance and horrific gas mileage it didnt get beyond the novelty stage,habitat1
3677,November 2012,2004 tl 6 speed  so in car years you do drive a 2007 honda 6pd  now i understand so maybe you are an honda target  most of us here also understand that acura has not done its part to own 2 spots on the car list to the rightsorry billy some of us have voiced this many times over but hosts seem to be clinging to the idea that the tl and acura should still be listed is the acura next in actuality caddy a domestic car maker has better offerings    love the talk of left foot actionjust be careful lots of dsg and cvt lovers here they will rant all day long about how much better they are texting also better with this option the 75k talk the tesla talkgreat stuff but prob wrong venue until the new 2015 3 comes out then that price could be a true comparison hearing leather will be standard,sweendogy
3678,November 2012,2004 tl 6 speed  so in car years you do drive a 2007 honda 6pd    not quite the 2004 tl 6speed also came with brembo brakes a noticeably firmer sport suspension and summer performance tires compared to the automatic since switched to high performance all season so even though the honda and some other fwd cars now have comparable horsepower i would still put my 2004 tl as one of the best handling and braking fwd mid size sedans ive driven unfortunately with the latest generation the fwd tl has morphed into more of an honda plus and the awd one is nearly a quarter ton heavier and does not have a separate sport suspension set up even on the 6speed manual version    i do agree a bit with your underlying point though acura has not really acted like they want to be a distinct luxurysport division from the mothership honda certainly not the way lexus has gone well above toyota in product design and pricing with the ls and gs models hell even hyundai has a v8 rwd sedan that is priced higher then the droopy flagship rl and they didnt need a luxury division label to give them the balls to try infiniti has its own set of problems but at least when they started with the q45 they had the ambition of going above nissan in a relatively big way    the good news for acura is that i think honda is a stronger starting point then toyota and way above nissan but id like to see them show more commitment to designing and building cars that seriously compete with audis audi and above and bmw 5 series and above in the sport luxury segment the acura really weve already had the acura acura acura and the xxx do we really need another model that begs the question where does this fit in between the honda honda and tl they appear to be stuck in perennial underachievement    note to acura please acura give me something with rwd and a 5050 weight balance to seriously consider over a bmw or 550i 6speed and s6 go ahead and borrow some hyundai balls to price it at 5060k if you do it right ill buy one i promise,habitat1

3685,November 2012,i think its because cars are too similar once upon a time they were all designed by people who didnt know what they were doing in fact it wasnt until about wwii that it was decided to put things like gas pedals and so on in the configuration that they are now in or to decide which direction doors would open up    so occasionally you got a real gem in the middle of the crap because people were trying everything and anything to be different and maybe make a breakthrough    today cars are all jellybeans and are all designed by people that all went to the same half dozen design schools you feel like you had to compromise because every car is a compromise by the time it gets through a dozen layers of management and meetings    your next car should be a classic something that is different simple and about the driving not about the options something that has soul and wont depreciate out from under you,plekto

3712,December 2012,060 might be the worst reason to pick one car over another id take a minimallyoptioned cayman s stickshift over a nissan gtr    i would agree the new cayman s is likely the best handling porsche this side of a 400000 carrera gt i am pretty much sold dealer here has offered me his first slot to be delivered in april will likely pay full msrp and maybe get a free porsche logo hat thrown in ah well i like a deal but id rather have this car    and if i cut my brains out in a chainsaw accident and wake up wanting to turn the cayman into a nissan gtr that can be done simply get a turbo kit that takes it to 480hp and throw 23 large farm animals in the hatch to take the weight up from 2900 lbs to 2 tons in which case you billy sweeny and everyone else here has authority to shoot me and put me out of my misery,habitat1
3713,December 2012,060 might be the worst reason to pick one car over another    oh come on we can think of way worse reasons p    to be perfectly honest though acceleration is near the top of my comparison list but its obviously not the only yardstick  17 ford crew 27 67 coronet rt 14 towncountry limited 09 lsubaru hse 44car history and counting,qbrozen
3714,December 2012,cant argue the passion for driving and wanting a great handeling manual trans sports car the gtr is in another class being a super car the boxters are real nice drivers car good luck on the purchase but do me a favor and never pay list,sweendogy
3715,December 2012,the gtr is in another class being a super car    dont want to get too far off track here but have you ever driven a gtr i have and other than flooring the accelerator there isnt much super about the experience for me not to be crude or sexist but buying one would be like picking a wife or girlfriend based solely on maximum bust size without regard to the fact that you get an enormous waist and butt to go along with it the gtr is ugly outside ugly inside and has a curb weight closer to a porsche cayenne than a porsche cayman yes the performance numbers are good but the two tons and awd completely eliminate sense of visceral nimble handling on public roads super car to me is a term to reserve for a gt3 or 458    i hope not to pay full msrp on the cayman s but as with real estate its better to get only a fair deal on a great car than a great deal on only a fair car,habitat1
3716,December 2012,i have not had the luxury to drive the worlds best nissan but in my eyes and the journalist it is as this recent article will suggest    httpmychicagotribunecomsection1articlep2p68906135    as they say in big business  paying retail is for skers,sweendogy
3717,December 2012,as they say in big business  paying retail is for skers    well if you were lucky enough to be one of the few hundred buyers to pick up a brand new ferrari 430 or 458 at the msrp you could have driven it for a year sold it and bought a gtr with the profit of course that would get you quickly knocked off ferraris a list for future purchases me thats not a list ill soon  or ever  be on    i hope this makes you almost as happy as me  i just put a deposit on a 20134 cayman s at a discount off msrp and am 1 on their list for a customer ordered car porsche wont take the order for another few weeks and i wont get the car before april but i think my shopping is over      regarding the gtr if you must have 060 in under 3 seconds for 100k my choice would be to buy a 23 year old preowned 911 turbo s the only thing that will get you to 60 quicker is a bugatti the porsche is a little more refined for my tastes and doesnt look like it was created by an uncooperative committee of nissan designers that used the plymouth barracuda for inspiration plus porsche still believes in offering manual transmissions  an unfortunate rarity in the world of supercars    httpwwwmotortrendcomroadtesthyundai1206nissangtrblackeditionvspor    sche911turboscomparisonviewallhtml,habitat1
3718,December 2012,bit all over the place the 911 turbo prob a better car but again its 70k more thats a huge chunk of change and in terms of  of msrp difference you could by a boxter as a daily driver if you wanted    congrats on the order and nice work paying less then sticker,sweendogy
3719,December 2012,i have and other than flooring the accelerator there isnt much super    and what track did you drive this gtr    how about this    httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvmum4fm85zm    btw this video shows just how fast the gtr is around a race track since it broke the record on this lap    not bad for porky car    to fair the gtr is an amazing car for the speed and handling the the car can do for its weight,flightnurse
3720,December 2012,note that i said 23 year old preowned 911 turbo s the turbos depreciate at a faster rate than the gt3  as further evidence of what the serious enthusiasts really enjoy driving the independent porsche service place i go to has a legendary master mechanic and former race team member who has even disconnected the front wheel drive on a number of 993 and 996 turbos because of the enthusiast preference for rwd,habitat1
3721,December 2012,that is correct ed prices are negotiableexcept i do not believe there is any ed discount on m models    if the car is built in germany and imported to the us then the car is part of the ed progdodge hondaing to bmw website a bmw is discounted 4100 through the ed progdodge which means you can get a better price than that take a quick long weekend trip do the ed progdodge and then pick up the car in spartanburg ,flightnurse
3722,December 2012,so basically price won out    no if price was all that mattered i could have saved 13k on an acura the x5d just seemed like the right combination of attributes appeal and best relative value without the full 4500 eco credit it probably would have still won out just not been the nobrainer it was at the lower price why someone would pay more for a comparably equipped x5 35i is still beyond me,habitat1

3727,December 2012,ok so all is well after my 2011 328xis 1st service ecu was reflashed which got rid of the cold start revving a loose wire was found to be the trouble of the tail light on the left rear trunk causing the light to flicker the hinges on the hood were adjusted so it is now aligned properly  a faulty trunk latch will be replaced in about 3 weeks when the part arrives the car was washed  vacuumed believe me it needed it    so ive got a few parting comments about the bmw they gave me as a loaner car    between monday night and tonight i put 231 miles on the diesel loaner the needle was at the 12 mark when i filled up and it said i still had over 300 miles until empty i did a little more highway driving than normal because i had to drive my grandma home after dinner about 25 miles and then return the loaner another 28 miles    i filled up with diesel that was 433 per gallon super at the same station was 419 per gallon i did see another station that was selling diesel for 459 and super for 429    in 231 miles i averaged 423 mph  322 mpg i was driving normally and not trying to get good gas mileage it just happened    i hopped into my 328xi and headed back home i backed into the driveway and checked my trip computer 388 mph average speed 215 mpg    both cars have their positives and negatives    the bmw obviously has a huge advantage when it comes to power 425 lb ft of torque  argh argh argh and fuel economy pretty much 10 mpg better real world the passing power this car has is just unreal push down on the throttle and it just goes pulls like a freight train    my 328xis steering is actually heavier than the rwd bmw handling was hard to judge because i was driving a car with tires that needed to be replaced and it is someone elses 50k  bmw that i didnt want to wrap around a tree or telephone pole    the 425 lb ft of torque rwd  balding tires made the cars wet weather traction squirmy i even saw the dtc light flicker a few times on dry pavement    my 328xi was noticeably quieter and smoother than the bmw the around town diesel clatter didnt bother me but the cars n52 inline 6 just sings and loves to rev    the verdict the diesel motor is just incredible the fuel economy it gives is just an added bonus for me to put one in my driveway would most certainly cost me more than the buyout on my 328xi plus id have to invest in a set of dedicated winter wheels  tires and possibly get a used winter beater jeep or subaru    the other diesel cars on the market either wont match up to the way my 328xi drives volkswagen volkswagen volkswagen volkswagen tdi are all fwd or they are a lot more money x5s arent cheap even used it has peaked my interest to give a 4 cyl bmw diesel a chance x1 x3 3 series assuming they are out when my lease is up in september 2014  2001 prelude type sh 2015 infiniti q40 awd 2017 honda honda touring awd,nyccarguy

3733,December 2012,diesel x1 would be pretty sweet which is probably why we wont get one in the us    not in this current generation we wont but the next generation im betting we will get a diesel x1 the currently x1 is very small and at least here in phx hasnt sold very well im thinking a x3 might be my next bmw but i am waiting for the diesel to be released first,flightnurse
3734,December 2012,actually saw my first x1 on the road yesterday there was a toyota in front of it which it seemed to be just marginally taller than and it was followed by a vue which was just slightly bigger its within a few inches of a honda too and considering the price of an honda honda  seems to me the x1 should be doing pretty well    have they even been advertising it cant say ive noticed any ads for it  17 ford crew 27 67 coronet rt 14 towncountry limited 09 lsubaru hse 44car history and counting,qbrozen
3735,December 2012,x1  while the power trains are interesting  and sure it starts around the same price as a honda honda but the options like all bmw are outrageously priced want heated pleather seats 700 bux want rear camera which is standard on basic some no lux autos these days 900 bux  how does a 32k starting price car have a options package for 6600 bux is a joke  could be a great car who knows but for the money a 2 year old x3 could be a better scoop,sweendogy

3740,December 2012,sween we dont agree on a lot of things but what you said here about the options from bmw i do agree with you i want to pull the plug on a 550 xi but when priced out the way i want it i would probably end up breaking the bank i might drive the tl for a few more years until the new car itch surface again probably next summer,billyperksii
3741,December 2012,yes the luxury germans are ridiculous for options no doubt    however i could be wrong but i dont think it takes much to make it equal to a honda its personal preference but id rather have bmw pleather than honda leather granted if those things matter to you you have to add the cold weather pack for 700 and panododgeic moonroof for 1250 both wind up being better than the honda heated steering wheel and bigger moonroof but you get the idea    all in all if it were my money there is no doubt which way id go for about 15 higher msrp    and yes a used car is always a better buy imho  17 ford crew 27 67 coronet rt 14 towncountry limited 09 lsubaru hse 44car history and counting,qbrozen

3754,January 2013,i looked closer and it seems its getting stranger by a minute 320i uses 2 liter turbo with 180 hp 5000 rpm bmw uses same 2 liter turbo with 240 hp 50006000 rpm thats 70 hp from same displacement the spec page shows torque of 184 lbft 320 vs 255 lbft 328 as similar revolution range those are big differences acceleration 060 is 71 sec vs 58 sec but i bet it looks completely different for 5080 mph which is much better measure of driving experience european magazines test this basically showing passing ability and strength against wind resistance    so unless the gas mileage gain is trully significant i see this trim failing miserably i suspect they introduced it only to get better cafe and to justify even more price hikes on 328 and 335  2018 430i gran coupe,dino001
3755,January 2013,320i uses 2 liter turbo with 180 hp 5000 rpm bmw uses same 2 liter turbo with 240 hp 50006000 rpm    same engine different tuning    i suspect they introduced it only to get better cafe and to justify even more price hikes on 328 and 335    i think they are introducing this trim in order to increase the sellingleasing price of the 328 and to increase unit sales for bragging rights    one can lease the bmw today at 369 lets say the 320i leases at 349 then it gives bmw the room to move the bmw to 399 a month while still offering the frugal buyers the 320i for 50 a month less,robr2
3756,January 2013,i know it is the tuning but it seems to me such move will be justifiable if fuel economy gains are substantial so far they are tbd    inot a lease buyer not that im against them just never found one i liked as wagons dont have same level of subsidy as sedans so i cant comment if 50 per month is ther right level leases can be done at almost any payment level what counts for me is the sticker and street price loaded 320i at 45 grand almost as much as my e90 328 was is jumping the shark  2018 430i gran coupe,dino001
3757,January 2013,loaded 320i at 45 grand almost as much as my e90 328 was is jumping the shark    if you tick any boxes on any bmw the prices become ridiculous 50k  for a 335 ridiculous imho,robr2

3761,January 2013,partly it is lack of competition and partly it is because they are some of the best cars in their classes for fuel economy and i think i am responding even though your comments are probably for dino i am a diesel supporter and think the market has been suppressed i think that if there were more offerings we would probably have around 2025 of the market being diesel therefor the current 2 is unrepresentative,scwmcan
3762,January 2013,sure they might be the enthusiast choice but for 910ths you can save 20 and get a comp car with better technology and more hp so are you really getting a better car     thats the better question that should really have a for you attatched to the end since everyone has their own priorities and preferences i could cancel my 2014 cayman s order and get 40 more horsepower for 20k less in a new chevrolet does that make it better not for me the chevrolet design albeit improved still looks like it has to many subaru pontiac designers trying to get their two cents into it and i dont need to spend anything for a car that i dont like to look at    you are an infiniti g guy  i would have liked to join your camp back in 2004 having had a great 150k experience with my 1995 nissan nissan se but i was disappointed in the lack of refinement in the infiniti pontiac5 sedan vs the tl 6speed i had to make the tough compromise of going with a fwd car but given that it washas been a daily driver and we have a second home in the snow belt i accepted the trade off i certainly respect those that go the other way and the infinitis 6speed is a damn nice car but is still just a perplexing notch away from the engine and transmission refinement that i think infiniti is capable of    also lets not forget that japanese horses are a bit more of the shetland style than germanys clydesdales the former bmw havent driven the new one with a stick was still the quickest ellps on the market in spite of a 30 rated horsepower disadvantage to infiniti and as quick as the 450hp450 ftlb chevrolet is likely to be i still doubt it will significantly outrun the 911s in spite of a 50hp125ft lb advantage on paper,habitat1

3766,January 2013,sween im afraid the competition will keep up in terms of pricing everything is getting more expensive loaded ford ford is getting close to 30 grand on the sticker    bingo mark my words dinan will have a reflash for the 320i and it will keep the factory warranty so a 320i for less then 40k and have the same performance as a bmw is a good thing    the new wagon will be an excellent value with the diesel engine,flightnurse
3767,January 2013,flight    you conveniently avoided my previous post with an excerpt from dinans own website that forewarned that essentially there is no free lunch and reflashing will result in greater engine stress and wear go back to my previous post for the direct quote or read through their homepage    and dinans willingness to match bmw 450 engine warranty is not much consolation when modern engines should easily last 150k miles hell i could probably do fine over the next month or two having a 5 hour energy drink for breakfast lunch and dinner but i dont think that would be a wise long term solution to just eating right and getting exercise    i dont know the percentage of daily driving 3series buyers that go to their local dinan store for a pick me up to try to turn their 328s into 335s and their 335s into bmw but my guess is the percentage can be counted using less than the fingers on one hand  and a thumb isnt a finger i do know that the resale value of an everyday bmw that has had the reflash or other engine modifications is significantly reduced and i suspect that its not permitted in a lease it certainly will never qualify for a bmw cpo warranty    so the idea of reflashing a 320 might be an option for you and a handful of your buddies but thats really not comparing factory apples to factory apples for 96 of the market maybe 99,habitat1
3768,January 2013,i was checking out the website at the local bmw dealer recently some nice 2010s maybe 11s also and the service loaners looked like a particularly good deal    i really want one someday i guess 6 years from now when i might be able to buy myself another car i may be able to afford a 2010    i had such a great plan get me wife the 2007 x3 i found for a good price then get me a slightly used 328 for every day duty and something cheaper for my daughter would have been the same price in total of what we ended up getting 3 cars but i would not be stuck with the cheap old one    she just got hung up on having to have a brand new car  2018 hyundai hyundai sport mine and 2013 acura acura awd wifes,stickguy
3769,January 2013,stickguy i resisted the siren call of bmw for most of my adult life because new ones always seem just a bit too expensive i passed up on the 2002s 320is and the wonderful e90s until one fine day i stopped in at a bmw reseller near my office and priced secondhand e39s    i ended up getting a 4 yo 2000 bmwa for about half the original msrp ive put 100000 miles on it in the eight years since and it still looks and runs great that strategy was so successful that i decided last winter to get a 2001 bmw cabrio to serve as my winter ride while im in arizona for the cold months this particular car had just under 80k on it and cost about what a new ford would it has given me no problems at all thus far    bmw have a pretty steep depreciation curve why not take advantage of the fact that so many of them are leased with strict limits on yearly mileage  and grab a lightly used one    buying used is the best way to enjoy bimmers imo  2000 bmw bmw 2001 bmw bmwc,andys120
3770,January 2013,simple you have the money to spread around multi dealership trying to decided what you want to buy we all get that there are people who can not so that is why turner companies are out there and have done very well dinan works with bmw anytime dinan does any work whether it is stage 1 suspension kit or superdodge kit the vin  is sent to bmw the failure rate for dinan engine work is very low about the same as bmw themselves so having an dinan or just go to your local bmw dealer and buy a b7 from bmw turners today are the what they were 20 years ago i would only work with turners who have a working relationship with the manufacture ie dinan    so i understand you dont like tuners that is fine others do there are many guys on bimmerfest who would tell something else i just love watching the vidvolkswagen they post of bmw playing with 911s on the freeway and the 911 guys doesnt get it a couple of guys have 90k on their bmw that are making 440hp rwhp they have been from day one of ownership original owners havnt had any major engine problems,flightnurse
3771,January 2013,funny but a loaded ford ford could have a boatload more tech then a 180 hp bmw and also be cheaper and very close in performance     shark has been jumped ,sweendogy
3772,January 2013,i didnt disagree that dinan is one of the best most reputable tuners around and they can be a relatively good bang for the buck in performance i simply restated what they stated on their website asking more out of a smaller engine will besult in more engine wear so my take is that somebody that is very performance minded goes to the track on occasion or regularly and doesnt care about shaving some life off the second 100000 miles on the engine the dinan option is a viable one but for those that are counting on the car being a daily driver for 810 years and do not want to take the risk of dians admittedly increased engine wear might think twice    i have a friend who took his 996 turbo to over 600hp650 ft lbs at the wheels through a porsche approved tuner as well the car has been timed at under 10 seconds in the quarter mile putting him a few tenths and a couple million dollars ahead of a bugatti veyron so yes i understand the economics i just still dont see you acknowledging the increased engine wear factor  whether or not that is of importance to you it will be to many,habitat1

3787,February 2013,i read the test report today in usatoday online of the new acura acura the price came in at 61000 the thing is this was a frontwheeldrive version and it was noted that the awd version wouldnt be here til fall and that the way the thing got to awd would be by the addition of two electric motors one each driving a rear wheel comment was that this would add complexity and cost and a heavy battery pack    the car is probably every bit as nice to drive as healy says it is but for 61k you can get a very well equipped audi audi or bmw 5 both of them awd variants the acura isnt ugly its just boring looking too    what were they thinking    what will drift down to the new tchrysler or whatever it is called will the tl at least retain the availability of shawd i think only awd tls should be offered  to really be in the ellps class    to my eye a top o the line volkswagen looks more premium than the acura and the current tl  and i know i have one    what makes something belong to a certain class  it seems the lines have become blurred somewhat there is no way i would put this new acura in the lps class despite a 61k msrp as tested    i thought too that lincoln was having a case of wishful thinking when they wouldnt allow their new baby to be tested against an toyota  since the lincoln folks clearly didnt want to see their new lincoln motorcar hanging out with the riff raff    and i do agree with a previous poster that the hyundai certainly seems to pass the smell test insofar as it being able to pass as a premium or at least entrylevelpremium if such a thing exists    i mentioned my airline honda friend  a long time bmw ownerdriver  got a hyundai r spec hot on the heels of owning a bmw 5 and he loves it he probably doesnt count though since he usually just goes from his house to the airport long term parking and back a 5 series probably was overkill for his twice weekly commute    in any case i started out wondering who in the widewideworld of sports would pay 61k for a frontwheeldrive acura i dont see it confuse,markcincinnati

3789,February 2013,i agree one should wait on an acura product but not due to quality but to performance because the current line awd tl included is a dog and has been since the acura and tl redues  its amazing how long they have gone without producing a solid exciting sedan the acura is in what its 6th year in current form and by far its best product but ive been saying this for years yes infiniti hit it right with the first g the second even better coupe convert and awd right in the form of what they are chasing   somehow offering much more at price dollar for dollar even the biggest bmw lover could not disagree  they did it right lets hope the new audi0 continues this but i will miss the g name dk much about the m or its impact sure its a nice car but even as an infiniti fan has it left a real mark i dont know,sweendogy

3802,February 2013,i like the m too however for the price i think a 5 series is a better car the price for a bmw6 is slightly less 1500 then a 550i id take the twin turbo v8 over the infiniti v8 and a 550i can be had with a manuel something the infiniti lacks the e class is not a sport sedan unless you look at the amg model,flightnurse

3813,March 2013,scwman classic responce  my rebut  evenif its 4k down and thats an if you get a brand new bmw with free maintence for 3 years  and if you are a recent grad and have an entry level job you dont have to worry about a new transsssion or something similar that you would get in a used car plus you dont have to pay the full nug at pickup  a good used car thats 5 years old depending on model is a min 10k lux cars could be close to 20 or more    not saying anything wrong with a used car  but a new car under certain lease requirements and given certain situation is not a bad option and could be a better option rock on    i got an acura gsr in 2000 for 25o a month 1500 down could not get a better deal had a 3 year lease warrantee  no issues i was a young buck just out of college  last 3 cars have been bought new all bought but even if i had the money i would still finance because the rates are so low case in point after trade we owed less then 5k for my wifes honda i financed for 60 mths at 9 because rate was so low not because we didnt have the extra 5 all about what fits,sweendogy

3819,March 2013,i have no problem if they can afford the payments as i said they can do what they want and you did bring up the bmw which is what i replied to it would be slightly more reasonable to get a new honda or whatever but that was not what was being discussed here it was the leasing or purchasing an entry level luxury car right out of college now nobody but the actual person knows what their financial situation is so really we have no business deciding what they should be doing with their money  as i stated in the my original reply and the payments on the bmw may be about the same as on the honda  though with a bigger upfront payment so why not go for it if you can and want to but in general it make more sense to have fewer and lower payments to get yourself out of debt before you go adding new debt of course i agree with the size of many peoples student debt they cant put their lives on hold for twenty years but a lot of people seem to want it all as soon as they graduate and get into further financial difficulties i guess all i am saying is they have to make sure they can actually afford what they buy and that they have to be aware that just because you get a job as a fresh graduate doesnt mean they are going to still have that job in a year or two  in todays workplace there are very few guarantees and that they also need to budget savings so they can afford to survive and continue to pay for things in the event they do lose that great first job in other words dont live beyond your means its not just advice for governments it is for all of us,scwmcan

3821,March 2013,all standard leases include gap coverage putting money down on a lease is a bad idea period it is usually based on desire to lower payment and projecting what one should do on a loan where large downpayment is actually a good idea the difference is in completely different type of risk in each of those financing schemes loan puts risk of ownership on the buyer lease puts it on the bank so banks will love people putting money down on a lease  2018 430i gran coupe,dino001
3822,March 2013,dino  i dont like to dispute what you say because you always research before you make your point and very well i might add but i think gap insurance laws vary by state i know where i used to live ny that gap insurance is included in every single auto lease  finance contract written in the state where i live now ct gap is something they push on you in the fi office  2001 prelude type sh 2015 infiniti q40 awd 2017 honda honda touring awd,nyccarguy

3844,April 2013,thank you everyone for your advice this weekend i continue the saga to find my next car and heres the report    mercedes benz cclass c300 4matic   i really like this car it looks refined outside and elegant inside the ride is composed though it feels heavy and a tad slow vs my tl the c300 has 248hp  awd vs my tl 258hp that maybe why  infiniti infinitix   i like the infiniti design but its dated not much change even since the pontiac5 and overall i find the g styling works much better with the coupe than the sedan interior is decent nothing wow but overall good impression   man this car is fast 328hr really works here however like many have said before the engine is not refined   so my overall impression with the infinitis is so so i think infiniti know it so they throw in an outstanding lease deal right now    so at this point im kind of leaning toward the c300    then the next morning i took my tl out for an oil change while waiting i saw a cadillac dealer right across the street i hate cadillac art  science design language to the point i think id feel embarrassed driving one but ive been seeing and hearing enough about the new ats that i decided to give it a try  cadillac ats 20t   first off i think the ats looks the best among the current cadillacs the new cts looks very good too when i saw it at the ny auto show but its not current yet it looks sporty and smart the led arch looks better in real life than on tv the interior looks pretty nice too with attention to details some negatives the dashboard stitching is a good attempt but looks fake the high gloss center control looks cheap and the silver buttons line up transformer style looks kiddy i thought only ats suffers from this layout perhaps the designer tried too hard to make it look young but surprised to find the same button line up and layout in the cts too bad without these negatives the ats cabin could be one of the nicest in its class   the drive awesome wow this is the first time that i feel the fun to drive that people have been talking about it feels light and fast yet composed and firm the only car to this point that i want to keep on driving during the test drive   after the initial excitement i went home and did some research about the ats owners review it looks like the cue still has a lot of problems and gas mileage is far below what cadillac claimed its kind of expected for a car in its 1st year of its 1st gen   so i think the ats is a great car but not a car for now    now the remaining candidates are bmw bmw bmw and mb c300 4matic then wife said bmw so bmw it will be,leoblue

3850,April 2013,all fine cars in their own way but quite a bit different from each other so the answer really depends on what is important to you based on these choices the fact that you are leaning toward the es says to me that you desire quite comfy luxury not sporty if so fine choice    in this group i will say that driving them all is key  2018 hyundai hyundai sport mine and 2013 acura acura awd wifes,stickguy
3851,April 2013,lexusbuyerbased solely on your user name id say your mind is alreayd made up    gotta agree with stickguy here all are fine cars but if you are looking for that isolated feel of an lexus youll probably be disappointed in the others youre looking at nothing wrong with that its all personal preference    i think the es was either new for this year or last year at the earliest    what are your priorities in what your looking for those might help with your decision making and it might help us understand which way to steer you  2018 acura tchrysler sh awd aspec,graphicguy
3852,April 2013,lexus es is front wheel drive whereas the other three are rwdbased or awd if you choose such that makes a big difference in handling on dodgeps and corners lexus is toyotabased but i would not say its just a toyota because thats not really fair however it will definitely share some characteristics with its common sister    if you are interested in feel of luxury at a great price quite and smooth ride especially on long trips dont really care or cant even understand what we are talking about about handling es is absolutely perfect im not mocking you or anybody else who doesnt care about handling i know a lot of people like that and i dont think of them any less they sit in crown vic or ford and dont miss what i would makes them happier and thats fine theyre happy with engine pull again  not mocking anyone just stating the fact    lexus will have all luxuries and possibly more that you want and money still in the wallet left great corporate reliability plenty of clever stuff inside i was impressed when i saw some features in my coworker s its a fine car just not for me i like sharper steering new bmw is already too dull for me i like the previous models more that rwd or awd can offer dont mind to pay for it with bit more road noise i like manual transmissions if i can have one id gladly pay for it some ats are really good too i just take mt as long as i can  just me i cant say much about infiniti other than it was developed to chase 335 buyer with lower price point or 328 buyer with samesimilar price point but better performance it is a bit old tech today but it may be a good thing bmw and mb need to improve gas mileage so they go with these 4cylinder turbos infiniti stays true to high output naturally aspirated v6 that is not very frugal but is a rocket they can afford it as i believe their mpg is averaged with parent nissan i dont know for sure but why else wouldnt they come with similar engines already i would call it most old school ellps of the bunch    if i needed one today and could afford it 335 is best for me but i have no problem with somebody saying lexus is better for them i can even see why and acknowledge those as valid reasons bottom line  its trully matter of priorities  2018 430i gran coupe,dino001

3854,April 2013,looks like a lexus fits your bill    maintenance costs are going to be a bit high have a neighbor who has two lexi he is contstantly complaining about how high maintenance is even for routine maintenance then again someone has to pay for those oppulent showrooms    any of these vehicles will go for 200k miles as youre aware strict maitenance is key however    value for moneyhmmmmlooking at that and low maintenance desires smooth ride big back seat have you looked at one of hyundai premium cars the equs or hyundai they have great warranties my son had an hyundai and it was uber cheap to maintain and it lasted him a good long while  2018 acura tchrysler sh awd aspec,graphicguy
3855,April 2013,i think you should look at the acura tl its front wheel drive like the lexus gets excellent mpg rated very high reliability and low maint especially if you plan on keeping it a long timewhich you indicated the german cars will no doubt cost you more time and money after you get out of warranty time and miles if you have to deal with snow the lexus and tl being fwd will be a little better for traction the acura tl also comes in a awd version but based on your stated use and not caring that much about the handling i wouldnt recommend it as it is heavier get less mpg and cost several thousand more why pay for it if youre not really going to use it the germans are all rwd with awd being optional but if you have to contend with a lot of bad weather and snow you would probably need the awd which again raises the price and lowers the mpg    if it were me and i had the same buying criteria that you have i would go with either the lexus or the acura,m6user
3856,April 2013,thanks bmwuser i did try out the acura tl also it did not feel as smooth as lexus and also felt a little small from inside compared to lexus the controls on lexus were much better also i guess these are the personal things one notices after the test drive overall i like acura tl also    i live in norcal with no weathersnow issues,ilexusbuyer
3857,April 2013,yes the lexus is a little smoother and bigger inside as its now based on the toyota and not the toyota as someone else mentioned in fact if youre not totally immune to a toyota versus lexus you might take a look at the toyota from what i saw at the auto show and from what ive read about it it seems to have an almost luxury class interior and the same drivetrain as the lexus for about 58k less money,m6user
3858,April 2013,for work i travel and rent a lot of cars lately i have been renting many buick buick i have to say im pretty impressed with them they are comfortable roomy good power and get decent mpg the price difference between a top of the line buick and es is about 10k which is a lot of money as graphic has pointed out you are sold on the lexi why waste your time looking at other cars when you will have a hard time being objective looking at other cars however if you can be objective the buick should be one to look at btw what is your price range you want to spend also look at the new toyota toyota again you will save yourself about 10k,flightnurse
3859,April 2013,roomy would like the back seat as wide as possible for 3 to fit comfortable have two car seat and still have the middle person have enough room    i think you are looking in the wrong class size wise of cars any of these will fit 2 car seats in the back but fit a 3rd person comfortably in the back with the 2 car seats i dont think so are we talking high back booster seats or 5 point harness seats that need to be latched in    have you looked at the toyota toyota it is a bigger car than the es i think confuse it should get you the same comfortable ride you are looking for  that legendary toyota reliability p    one way to reduce your maintenance costs on a toyota or lexus would be to pay attention when you take the car in dont just drop it off to the service advisor  say the light is on it needs service usually unless it is something major the car will most likely require a simple oil change when the light comes on  2001 prelude type sh 2015 infiniti q40 awd 2017 honda honda touring awd,nyccarguy

3879,April 2013,one thing i note is that a lot of the cars mentioned are smaller eurosedans and while this is fine if you want a large car youre looking at a big lexus acura cadillac mercedes benz volvo audi or bmw others do make similar cars but they tend to be overpriced or far more sport than luxury    a quick run  down  acura pretty much the tl its basically a japanese buick buick thats not a bad thing as the buick was a fine car with nice seats acceptable features and a very nice and soft ride that it cost gm almost 35k to make each one was a whole other story    lexus pretty much the es here since it is based on the toyota platform its a clone of the tl pretty much aside from styling both are excellent highway chrysler and will last a very long time there also is the toyota which is a nice choice a well    volvo is a bit more interesting they have always driven markedly better than their american or japanese counterparts a little bit of sport to go with the luxury the volvo is a great vehicle and id honestly rather be driving one instead of yet another faceless jellybean ie  acura or lexus    on to mercedes benz their e class is a bit smaller than youd probably like its also as it has always been a mediocre inbetween car the problem is also that unless youre looking at cpo youre going to be out of your pricerange that said a 2 or 3 year old s class might be worth contemplating if you like mercedes benz something that just came off of an executive lease    of the models to be looking at the s350 bluetec is the one to consider it gets 2131 mpg better than the hybrid s class even and while it isnt a tiresmoking monster like the s550 is its not slow either would i personally buy a used s over a brand new lexus in a heartbeat  note  wait until this fall of course as depreciation will help you out currently cpo 2012 s350s run around 75k expect that to be 60k this fall a bit over your budget but its a stunning option that nobody would fault you for choosing    bmw its pretty much the 5 series you simply cant go wrong with one    audi is the audi its pretty much trying to be a 5 series clone id call this the same as the japanese rivalry between lexus and acura    and lastly we have the underdog cadillac now dont count them out immediately they hit a home run with the cts and its only real fault is that the size was wrong it simply cant fit more than four adults comfortably which it does as well as anything from europe i might add and it handles great as well it also has a much better gps system than anything mercedes benz or bmw has the mercedes benz gps is sometimes so bad that youd really be better off with your cell phone in a holder    so gm fixed that with an extended wheelbase version the cadillac of note as well is the magnetic ride suspension which is usually only found in exotic cars the thing drives and rides as well as a s class but its not 100k not even close its my personal favorite of the list because its so inexpensive especially if you can find a cpolease return one these usually have 3 or 5k miles on them and are essentially new except that someone else ate the initial depreciation taxes and registration their credit woes are your gain    httpwwwtracymotorscomvehicledetailscertified2013cadillaccadillac36lv6fw dplymouthma1954964653  a typical example    note  this is a smart thing to do with any new car actually,plekto
3880,April 2013,and while this is fine if you want a large car    you could throw the acura acura in the mix too not as large as the big euro cats but it is a midsize sedan with the same 102 cu ft as the buick buick and only one cu ft larger than the toyota    the acuras base price is around 48k but add the usual luxury features expected in a car of such luxury pretensions and that sticker climbs to 60k in a hurry reasonably equipped you probably could drive one home for 55k but who would want to anyway the acuras styling is pitiful and downright dowdy not even a name change back to the legend will move this metal    oops i take that back in february acura sold 16 and march 336 if my math is right that is a 2000 increasebut who is counting,bwia
3881,April 2013,sticki get what youre saying    ive driven quite a few of the recent versions of the tl the 15 sec 060 time delta between the tl sh awd and my s4 hondaing to motor week is significant and not one that ive ever experienced i can believe a 5 sec delta with the s4 being faster i cant believe the 15 sec delta motor week reported however    somethings not right with this motor week reportespecially given their previous tests results on the tl  2018 acura tchrysler sh awd aspec,graphicguy
3882,April 2013,lexus pretty much the es here since it is based on the toyota platform    nah ah now based on the toyota    re cadillac cadillac the thing drives and rides as well as a s class    highly disagree with that statement,carnaught
3883,April 2013,acura pretty much the tl its basically a japanese buick buick  ive never driven a tl and thought it was a buickthe early ones felt like fancy honda with much less headroom but the current generation is a distinctive product especially the shawd    lexus pretty much the es here since it is based on the toyota platform  based on the toyota    on to mercedes benz their e class is a bit smaller than youd probably like  havent driven the latestthey never felt small to me even when they were    audi is the audi its pretty much trying to be a 5 series clone  i dont see that at all if anything i see the audi as surpassing the 5 series in all aspects stylingdrying dynamicsprice    and lastly we have the underdog cadillac now dont count them out immediately  i havent driven the latest but the previous was very impressive i decided against it but it was still a nice ride the new one looks to have substantial improvements,ivan_99
3884,April 2013,ivanagree with your assessments    took another ride in an ats this time in my neighbors new caddy its a 20 turbo if gm could do something to make that engine a lot smoother and not so corse theyd go a long way to getting more people to hyundai up for the car  2018 acura tchrysler sh awd aspec,graphicguy
3885,April 2013,i drove my brotherinlaws new e class last week it seemed plenty big to me i even sat in the back for a short time of course the ride was quiet  smooth with plenty of power but the leather seats felt plastic like and most surprisingly the steering felt on the over assisted side which made me wonder can the steering type be selected by the driver maybe it was selected to the most assisted position,jeffm5
3886,April 2013,a quick run  down  acura pretty much the tl its basically a japanese buick buick thats not a bad thing as the buick was a fine car with nice seats acceptable features and a very nice and soft ride that it cost gm almost 35k to make each one was a whole other story    please let readers know that you refering to the base car and not the shawd,billyperksii
3887,April 2013,well sport suspension and tires plus a massively heavy awd system that 90 of people will never benefit from are a whole other animal the base model is styling aside a big well built fwd car that drives a lot like a buick ultra did the better gm cars didnt have a problem with handling if you got the touring or sport package    as for the audi yes i personally think that the audi is better than the 5 but if i said that at first id have had fifty bmw fanboys spamming me with hatemail but its small really if youre coming from a normal family sedan any of these will feel and drive superbly    the differences between the toyota and the toyota are kind of like the cadillac and the cts they share enough dna to be hard to guess what comes from what either way the es is a good big car that is great for long drives my only gripe is that honda and toyota overprice their cars by about 1020 and they never have meaningful incentives either that i can actually get a better deal at the end of a year on a mercedes benz is telling    oh id like to add one more car just for fun the lincoln lincoln its basically the new version of the towncar and it is a long long overdue update at that of note is how it will fit five large male adults with winter coats on inside it in comfort like the gm you get a lot of car for your money compared to the japanese and european brands,plekto
3888,April 2013,the differences between the toyota and the toyota are kind of like the cadillac and the cts they share enough dna to be hard to guess what comes from what    you realize that the cts and cadillac have little in common other than styling,robr2
3889,April 2013,pletkoi see where youre coming from those old buick park aves with the handling package and supercharged v6 motors were pretty good cars base tl while still a better handling car and a better performing cari could see a comparison made    now tl sh awd is really a different animal i dont know that anyone drives any car to its true capabilities that said when i had my tl sh awd i know the handling benefits could be felt every dayaround corners better steering feel confidence on twisting roads none of that touches its prowess in wetsnowy weather which was excellent    i agree with you on the audi vs the bmw 5 series for the money id choose the audi 30 all day every day its better car to drive and the tech that comes with that level of car is better than the 5 the audi handles better rides better too plus it will come in a few thousand under the 5 series equipped like for like    cant comment on the big caddy the only ones ive had any seat time in are the cts and the atsneither of which would be on my short list if i were plunking down my own money strong rumors around that the ats is falling short of gms sales expectations and theyre throwing trunk money at it  2018 acura tchrysler sh awd aspec,graphicguy

3902,June 2013,this topic is entrylevel performance sedans a category pretty much invented by the cars from munich a little homework about bmw might help you in this discussion if you find this too confusing perhaps your time would be better spent on other boards    here is a web site that untangles the mystery of bmw e and f listing all numbers and what they mean such as f30 is a 6th gen 3series saloon 2011    httpwwwcarmagazinecouknewssearchresultsindustrynewsallthebmweand  fcodenamesexplained    here is a summary of f model numbers f0103 1013 1516 2023 25 3035 4446 a summary of e model numbers e3 9 12 21 2326 28 3032 322 34 36 365 367 38 382 383 39 465 52 53 60 61 63 6568 70    perhaps bmw could have been putting a small chrome plaque on the trunks of their vehicles showing the e and f numbers    i would bet a cup of fancy coffee that the vast majority of bmw driversownersleasers many being the mcmanion variety have never heard of e or f numbers,xrunner2
3903,June 2013,perhaps bmw could have been putting a small chrome plaque on the trunks of their vehicles showing the e and f numbers    that would make more sense than the current scheme which makes little sense but theyd still have to distinguish between the various powerplants the f30 with a 2liter turbo diesel 320d is a bit different than the same chassis sporting a 300hp 3 liter gas turbo motor bmw perhaps they ought to have something like f30td20 or f30t30 on the tail    i would bet a cup of fancy coffee that the vast majority of bmw driversownersleasers many being the mcmanion sicvariety have never heard of e or f numbers    im not sure about the vast majority im sure most owners have no clue but enthusiasts know i thought the edmunds townhall was supposed to be a site for auto enthusiasts pick up a copy of road and track car and driver or autoweek and im sure youll find references to bmw type numbers  2000 bmw bmw 2001 bmw bmwc,andys120
3904,June 2013,i subscribe to motor trend and an edmunds user among others sure the major publications mention the f30 or e20 or whatever mention of past bmw 3s but if you read these publications you notice its mentioned once maybe twice never in the header and never in the stats sheet i would say vast is probably the correct terms i mean in the states the vast majority of 3s sold are 399 lease deals leader ads in flight terms right    i dont think enthusiasts need to remember the 2001 525xi was a f32 seriously bmw guys put down the single malt and the cuban and comeback to the real world  its make year and model then engine you are not special,sweendogy

3909,June 2013,the idea that one select car company i guess alfa guys do as well and its owners uses terms that are not widely used in a car connissantion is what it is this is not just a bmw forum and i think its douchie i never called anyone self centered but this idea that real car enthusiasts have to know the code for a 2001 525 is as noted by my cigar and scotch comment    and the nissan challenge was very one sided if you ask me shades,sweendogy
3910,June 2013,opinions and challenges are fine the tone can be a problem the nissan was a good challenge calling people self centered douches whether directly or not because they used some unmazdar vocabulary is not    as somebody who posts quite a bit in other edmunds forums but only mostly reads this one i do find this forum has quite a bit more attitude than others perhaps fitting of the higherend snobbish stereotype that im sure the forum posters dont want to convey to a general audience not directed at you but a general comment on the ellps forum,tlong
3911,June 2013,i personally dont find it snobbish i find it childish in a forum where adult car enthusiasts come to discuss debate learn about andor admire luxury performance cars slinging personal taunts and making ascerbic condescending comments brings the entire community down    im not saying anyone has violated this but here is the edmunds member conduct agreement for perspective    we welcome all points of view on automotive matters however although interactions within the community services occur in cyberspace everyday manners apply please respect and interact with fellow members as you would in any public arena civility and respect underlie the success of an online community if you wish to take issue with the statements of other members or the hosts please engage in healthy mature debate and not immature behavior or namecalling while we want to maintain an inviting environment for all visitors disruptive conduct such as offtopic comments in a topicoriented discussion in the forums is not allowed neither is spam eg posting your message in multiple places throughout the forums    as for the bmw e and f designations i agree most people dont have them all memorized and who does on the other hand we are mostly enthusiasts in this group and since it is the ellps thread the only bmw being routinely discussed here is the 3series and over the past 30 years there have only been five sedans    e30 e36 e46 e90 f30    the e90 20052012 and f30 2012present are clearly the most talked about here so if you only know those two youre good to go and if you dont want to learn them thats ok too  you probably call them beemers anyways so it doesnt matter    but for that oneinahundred mention of a nissan ecar if youre curious there are ways to be in the know for example people have used the mb w codes here before i dont know them but google is just a couple keystrokes away,fedlawman
3912,June 2013,i know it may not be in the same performance class as your current bmw wagon but it may be comparable to the latest one but the volvo volvo is coming to north america by all reports it is a very nice driving car and with bmw toning down the sportiness and volvo upping it a bit it may even wind up being a better drive  probably not but the volvo is apparently pretty good and since the volvo is the wagon version it should also be good  thogh of course since it wont come with a manual it will be off some peoples lists for that,scwmcan
3913,June 2013,as somebody who posts quite a bit in other edmunds forums but only mostly reads this one i do find this forum has quite a bit more attitude than others    i would agree but it appears to be due only to one or two people this board was really active for quite awhile years ago then went dead for quite some time when the regulars who populated it moved on to a couple of other boards there was no hint of attitude in the old days that i recall    when it came back to life there was and is the majority of people not posts people on here these days are fine and have interesting points of view for the others well thats what the scroll wheel is all about,cdnpinhead

3939,June 2013,speaking of volvo volvo they sold more of them last month may sales then honda sold tls and acuras    end of acura coming soon  for more sales numbers hyundai on link    the volvo volvo is an a very good car looks good drives good good value depending on modeloptions the acura tl even with the desperately needed 2012 nose job and butt lift is still not an appealing designnot as ugly as the 2009 tl but few if any cars are uglier than that    at the height of its popularity the tl sold 78218 units in 2005 even the 2008 model sold 48766 cars but the 20092012 tl has only sold in the low 30s each year topping out at 34049 in 2010    2013 ytd figures at may eom arent looking very good either so far the tl has sold 12434 units this year which is down 153 or 2242 units compared to this time last year    my beloved but ignored and soon to be discontinued acura is faring much worse year to date it has only sold 7746 compared to 15012 at this point in 2012 thats a decrease of 484 or 7266 fewer cars    the acura is hardly setting any records but it has sold 9217 units ytd that is almost 2000 more sales than the acura has lost compared to last year so people are obviously buying the acura instead of the acura but the acura desperately needs to replace the underpowered 150hp 20l engine used in all models with the 5speed at ive driven a 2013 acura premium with the 20l 5at and i was genuinely impressed with the car until i pulled onto the highway 060mph takes 95 seconds deadeven with the kia rio and hyundai hyundai with 6speed at even the cheapasdirt nissan nissan 16 cvt can hang neckandneck at 98 seconds    that kind of performance is tolerable if mediocre on a 15k car but on a 30k premium entrylevel luxury or nearluxury model its simpy unacceptable especially from a company that is known for making some great highperformance 4cylinder engines    acura was doing just fine with until 2009 when the godawful power plenum aka the shield and the beak corporate fascia debuted despite immediate negative response from the media and consumers and plunging sales figures they defiantly insisted that it was the new look of acuraand it wasnt nor has it been pretty since     i have owned seven hondaacura vehicles in my 24 years of driving ive owned nine different cars in my life and was a diehard honda loyalist from the day i got my license in 1990 until 2006 when i saw the new honda and walked away actually i drove off the lot in shock and terrified at the prospect of shopping for anything other than a honda but after some research and test drives i found myself right at home with a 2006 mazdaudi and now i have a 2012 mazda gt    but the best car ive ever driven and the best car ever made in my humble opinion was my 1994 acura legend l 4door i bought it in 1997 when it was returned at the end of a 36month lease it was frost white with taupe cloth and 5speed manual but that was exactly how i wanted it i drove until may 2001 when i was tboned by a speeding f250 work truck running a red light as i was making a left turn i barely survived but my legend did not     its sad to see acura where it is today ive felt much the same way about honda for the last several years also but the 2013 honda is so good and so much better than the 20082012 model that it replacedperhaps theres hope after all  20155 volvo volvo t6 drivee platinum 2012 mazda mazda gt,igozoomzoom
3940,June 2013,good post igozoomzoom    i honestly think acura would sell many more cars if they rolled back time and started making their 2006 lineup againlol    the acura is the only acura worth a look in its segment right now and even it is overdue for a refresh,fedlawman
3941,June 2013,the acura is selling very very well and the acura is still a very good seller guess which models acura makes more profit on so sales of certain models doesnt necessarily spell disaster as its overall profit that counts of course making good proift on all your lines is preferable but as long as youre making money its not exactly like youre going to go out of business honda didnt so so well over the past 5 years but several other models like the crx honda honda and honda sold well and with good profit margins    bottom line just looking at sales numbers of a couple of models is a fools delight acura is one good redesign away from being on track again with the tl and one good engine to make the acura a good seller along with the very profitable acura and acura sales they will be just fine,m6user
3942,June 2013,the new acura came out this week all new design basically a supersized acura with the hitech awd etc but same basic platform and drivetrain just more goodies and room    they do need to hurry up and redesign the tlacura i believe they are combining the 2 into 1 car into something competitive and exciting they can then also tweak the acura maybe go to the acura 24l engine6 speed combo    the acuratl tsl can grow a bit and offer 4 and v6 like the acura used to or follow the trend and go na and turbo    the acura is improved this year content wise pretty much they eliminated the base strippo model but kept the price close    so there is hope now that they did the big car and both suvs the other sedans are definitely due since the acura was done for 2009 so it is on its 5th year and tl the 6th  2018 hyundai hyundai sport mine and 2013 acura acura awd wifes,stickguy
3943,June 2013,while i agree the acura and its now a new acura and acura sell well very well they do not sell in numbers to keep the brand alone look at the sales numbers for every other car they produce and they are mid pack at best in terms of sales mind you mid pack means massive discounts and minimal if any profit honda on the other hand no matter how bad the previous honda and honda looked they stll were near the top of the sales chain i would also note that when the last honda was being slammed they quickly fixed it because its the real bread and butter of the brand    acura is one good redesign away from selling some cars for sure but they have to redesign a bunch of cars to do that    sales numbers tell the story they sold 200k honda in 2011 and when they did a redu they were very careful not to mess that up something they failed to do with the acura and tl,sweendogy
3944,June 2013,means massive discounts and minimal if any profit    you champion solid research all the timedo you have any information that indicates acura is making minimal if any profit if they are midpack then everyone below must be in chapter 11 i think a little exaggeration is being played here    but they have to redesign a bunch of cars to do that    ummhhno just a couple where do you get a bunch of cars they just totally redesigned the acura acura and acura the acura outsells the bmw x3 the audi and the ex37 nothing midpack there the acura is right up there in sales with most of them except the rx the rx has no little brother to share sales withyet nx is coming if it did the acura and rx would be pretty close in sales imo so saying that all their lines are midpack is probably another exaggeration    they have the acura which admittedly needs some tweaking they already have the 24l in the sport model of the acura they should just make that the base engine with a 6 spd auto they are apparently ditching the acura so the only car they really need to redo completelyand with a pleasing design hopefully is the tl or whatever they are going to call the replacement for the tlacura thats one carnot a bunch of cars,m6user

3946,June 2013,the acura is the only acura worth a look in its segment right now and even it is overdue for a refresh    as someone else already mentioned the redesigned 2014 acura has just been released in the last week or so it looks like a 54 version of the acura but thats not a bad thing based on current acura sales    ytd sales of the acura as of may month end were up 1221 over the same period in 2012 18177 units vs 8183 last year    i applaud acura for trying something different with the original acura and using a turbocharged 4cylinder but buyers in this segment want smooth v6 power just like the mazda cx7 a highperformance compactupscale cuv is interesting in theory but the reality doesn146t quite cut it    the acura was definitely due for a significant update after seven years with little change i test drove a 2012 acura last november when i was in the market for a 3row cuv and i still chose the 2012 mazda mazda gt the acura stickered for 44k and the mazda stickered for 39k and the mazda had more features better handling and the interior materials and assembly quality were also on part with the acura the lack of a fwd version of the acura was also a negative    the 145real146 price difference also made my decision much easier this was in 112012 and i could barely get the 2012 acura for 2500 off sticker around 41500 my mazda stickered for 38785 and i drove it off the lot for 29706 plus sales tax i paid cash for the mazda but probably would have leased the acura if i had picked it grandma was generous in her will but not that generous    back to the current and nearfuture of acura…the demise of the acura will take a sedan and wagon out of the lineup will the acura tchrysler and acura sedans and acura and acura crossovers be enough to keep the brand viable and return it to actual relevance    then again buick is doing well with less a compact sedan verano a sportyperformanceoriented midsize sedan buick and nearfullsize sedan buick along with a large crossover buick and minicrossover buick in particular the buick is a joke compared to the acura and the buick is no acura but somehow buick is more desirable than acura to most buyers…  20155 volvo volvo t6 drivee platinum 2012 mazda mazda gt,igozoomzoom

3948,June 2013,well bmw  i am the champion for research or atleast i do want a base for strong commentary as opposed to random thoughts case in point the 2013 tl shawd with tech pack we can mosltly agree would be a good example to use it has a msrp of over 44k invoice of 416 and hondaing to true car for my area use 02144 you can get it for 39588 3 dealers willing to do this deal  thats over a 10 discount the bmw 328 is down 4 the audi down 6 and ats caddy is 3 i just dropped some knowledge on you i understand you cannot truly tell what they are making or losing on these cars but it tells you something when it comes to discounting and fact is they are not making as much could be losing as they would like given the above figures second paragraph above again as i stated the 2 suvs sell well but lets remember how many acuras are they selling 50k last year acura  very good year vs the x5s 44445 the acura 29520 again very good year as they avg around 15k since inception the bmw x3 35173 bmw sells 100k 3 series in the states vs the tls 33k  so are they really beating them by that much to justify a tl that sells a third of the 3 series lets add in the acura 28865 sales from 2012 so 2 car lines make up half of 3 series sales acura no longer sells haha the zdx they sold 379 rl for 2012 379 wonder what the margins on the balance sheet on that one are was all numbers above are us numbers    i stand by my statements from 5 years ago they need a convertable a sports coupe a midlevel sedan with looks a flagship people want and a supercar which is comming thats a bunch in my estimation maybe we have differ thoughts on what is alot but when we are talking half a line of cars its alot    and for billy both sides of the balance sheet need to equal out to make it balance sheet,sweendogy

3960,June 2013,acura may be doing even better because their suv sales are better than infinitis and thats where a ton of profit is what are the numbers the profit you speak of you are saying they are making big profits but have yet to produce one number i present sales numbers you mock and are wild statements volume tells a story  its black and white  when they sell 350 rls it tells a story  reasons car companies produce cars its to sell cars on the infinti thing for sure they have made mistakes,sweendogy
3961,August 2013,i do like the s4s looks styling and engineering not too many buttons i did get button overload in the tl shawd and the center display behind the steering wheel was way too small for my tastes the acura just goes nuts with buttons and comes off as a techie car to me whereas the audi comes off as an engineers drivers driver car    however 55k is out of my budget im already stretching and blowing the budget if i start at a stripper base model no options s4 which will get close to 55k out the door anyway given ca taxes and dmv fees    realistically im looking at a 2 year old s4 at about 40k vs the tlshawd brand new    what year is your s4    the other problem with getting a stripped no options s4 is i would really really like the bang  olufsen sound system upgrade dsg no brainer to me and the rear sport differential those are pretty much must haves ok the sounds sytem isnt a must but highly worth the additional cost and you can get it as a stand alone addon also i wish i could get the nappa leather as a stand alone low cost upgrade as ive pointed out it takes the s4s seatarmrest door lining interior up to another level and you can also get red brown or white mixed into your black bolsters unfortunately i think it comes packaged only with the premium plus or prestige packages     this is why a 2011 or 2012 s4 could be in my future rather than the one i looked at which was a fresh off the boat brand spankin new 2014 model in a beautiful metallic pearl dark grey maybe because it was spotless and the tls typically had been sitting for awhile with 100200 miles on them it made the paint pop better on the audi    that 2014 s4 had all the upgrades 19 wheels nappa bo sound adaptive suspension bells and whistles 55k sticker talk about lust 19 wheels are highly unnecessary and expensive though each time you buy tires but they looked great trispoke design    its a shame your s4s been a dud reliability wise id be angry if that happened to me hopefully you were just unlucky and most s4s are reliable    if i was going to consider bmw which has a large share of reliability issues lately it seems it would be the bmw saw one at carmax for about 25k with about 37k miles 2009 sport package no need for awd on a bmw in so cal    i should probably take a look at infiniti i liked their interior design on the pontiac5s last i looked i want to try either rwd or awd for the next car  toy 16 audi tts audi awd commuter 17 volkswagen volkswagen alltrack se 4motion awd wifes 16 kia kia chrysler 16t fwd,andres3

3980,August 2013,andresi cant quarrel with any of your assessments pretty much the same feelings i have    the only differing opinion as mentioned i helped my sister buy a tl she also looked at the redone honda personally i could tell where the extra money went for the tlsuspension steering found both a bit too light for my tastes upgraded materials in the tl sound system etc but as you say for 25k youd be hard pressed to find a better car    the s4 is more hard edged than the tl as you say its lighter smaller more tossable its also faster the sc 30 is so sweet and even faster than the previous s4 v8 but the price for that isnt insignificant    if i hadnt had so many issues with the mmibo i might feel different but the tls navels trumps the s4s bo seats are nicer in the tl toobetter leather    id be interested in hearing your thoughts on the new lexus i came close to buying one a few years ago it was a little luxo rocket at the time i just couldnt get either of the two lexi dealers owned by the same guy to really get to what i thought was a fair price we did get within about 500 but then they acted like they were insulted that i wanted to get less than msrp    i think those same dealers are readily taking less than msrp now the lack of product from japans tsunami and all the bad press over their cars inability to stop a few years ago i think really hurt their businessat least locally  2018 acura tchrysler sh awd aspec,graphicguy

3982,August 2013,our 2011 infiniti is coming off lease  and infiniti has already tried to lure my wife into another infiniti with an early out or pull ahead deal you know where at least 3 months of the lease is forgiven plus any miles over are wiped off the books in the time fdodgee where we switched from german to japanese the primary motivation was the super subvented lease deals offered by at the time acura and infiniti weve actually grown to have more than a modest amount of appreciation for the infiniti and truth be told my 12 shawd tl advance acura has certainly made me confident that its reputation for durability is probably well deserved    the issue  of course there is an issue  is that theses otherwise fine cars still fall short of the driving pleasure of the german cars that have dominated our garage since 1977    weve driven recently    audi audi 20t 14 my  audi audi 20t audi 14 my  audi audi both 20t and 30t 13  14 my  bmw x3 with the turbo four 13 my  infiniti fx37 13 my  infiniti audi0xs 14 my  volvo volvo t6    ill jump to the most important points in my mind    the audi 30t can be very nicely configured for a hair under 50k  and compared to the s4 vs the audi feels like a bargain    the bmw nicely configured is breathtakingly expensive from an msrp standpoint perhaps there is a super subvented lease deal on it though    the audi audi 20t premium plus with sport package costs about the same as a not fully equipped infiniti audi0 awd  but the audi isnt nearly as quick the audi however feels like a very good deal the 2014 has a slight hp bump    id hold off on the audi until the new one comes here next year  it seems just like my 2009 audi prestige sport  not that that is a bad thing but it seems more dated somehow    the volvo is very nice but mostly because in t6 form it is very peppy the deals and lease progdodges on the volvos make them probably the most expensive  which is to say they cost too much    the infiniti audi0s awd is slightly north of 50k  and that is without vented seats and without blind spot monitoring the car is super nice  but it feels small inside and although the interior is a huge leap forward over the outgoing g 50k is too much for what you get if youre looking for performance  it seems to have it but the engine in the audi 30t is about a million percent smooooother    already the audi0 is being offered in awd trim for 399 per month on a super lease deal at least here in cincinnati  so maybe the breathtaking price of the audi0 at msrp should be taken with a grain of salt    too bad you cant get an audi with the audi supercharged engine in it and not have to pay the premium to jump into an s4    bottom line  it is a great time to be in the market for a new car however there may need to be a reality adjustment for infiniti  for as nice as it is we still cant call the bmw the german infiniti we still however call the infiniti the japanese bmw    based on the driving of these cars and yes i do know there are three cuvs in the above list the audi0 and the audi are the most rewarding  both in performance and luxury the audi if youre looking for a bargain basement sport luxury vehicle is also worthy of your consideration they must have done something to make the audi 20t feel that strong    the next few shopping months are gonna be fun    drive it like you live,markcincinnati

3984,August 2013,here is one aspect of the bundling of features and options the automakers seem hell bent to force onto us the nearly autonomous capabilities some of the technology seems to imbue these cars with comes at a huge cost  cost    i have now had blind spot monitoring for nearly 6 years  and as much as i am against the government telling us what we have to have must pay for etc i am literally dumbfounded that bsw isnt as standard as turn signals brake lights and seat belts infiniti for instance offers bsw as part of a package of technologies that literally makes the audi0 damn near capable of driving itself  and the charge is over 3000 audi and volvo charge 500 to 700  which has to be about 90 margin    my point is why not offer an unbundled price list  i dont want all the autonomous driving stuff at this point that you are forced to buy if you want the perfectly reasonable and proven bsw technology    on the other hand if you really do want all of the mitigating technologies offered i would understand a bundling discount    for years it used to be you had to order a truckload of options just to get a heated steering wheel  or you had to get leather seats if you wanted rear seat heaters    if there is a technology reason to bundle some feature set im ok with that  but at this point the current generation of autonomous technologies offered are just not likely to be used by either my wife or me  but we want bsw just like we want turn signals esp seatbelts and so forth    additionally so many of the new expensive options offered seem to be computer processor software or chip based  meaning super high gross margins why make me buy lane keeping technology and automatic cruise control when what i would find far more useful is bsw    assuming i can justify a 50k infiniti audi0 when a much nicer audi audi sport is about 1000 more and that includes bsw why ding me for yet another 3k when all i want is a fairly priced 600 technology that has saved me tens of thousands of dollars as it warned me my blind spot was full of a big ol vehicle just waiting for me to have a stupid attack,markcincinnati
3985,August 2013,seems like a long post for one option my opinion which means zero  you can get a 50k audi0 with bsw  im sure at that price point one would get a boatload more car then an 51k audi with bsw again ive not done the apples to apples research    this bsw must be something for one to go off on such an item one would also argue the bsw and other options on that package are options that most people would not want i like options packaging as long as the lower options sunroof and nav get priced at the lower end of the packaging range and not forced on you with other packages like bsm and lane departure  things i can live without i think the japanese have made options packaging a thing because it cuts down on costs german cars can be ordered ala cart which is cool     drive fast take chances  sween,sweendogy
3986,August 2013,yes a long post if the entire spirit of what i was on about was a single feature  my peeve is with the concept of being able to choose to select a set of features or to customize i am fine with the concept of discounting if a bundle is selected yet there are customers who would upgrade and add x option but are discouraged from doing so by virtue of the bundling cost    i read an article about the concept of the optionless vehicle in short since most of the options are software or firmware based it is actually more efficient to build every option possible into every car and charge those who want it    our ibm computer for instance has a capability called computing on demand essentially the computer is delivered with the biggest baddest cpu made  but it is hobbled at 60 70 80 etc capacity unless youre willing to pay for the extra horsepower some companies pay for 2 days of full horsepower once per month for the monthly demanding processing routines    my last audi  with the assistance of a free software progdodge and a 300 cable was able to have any number of features enabled or disabled via a laptop companies  both factory approved and not approved  offer performance upgrades via a reprogdodgeming of the vehicles onboard brain volvo even offers a polestar upgrade to its turbo engines  for a price    point is weve been at a time and place in technology where our cars are largely controlled by software so putting in every possible feature or option into every car and charging those folks like my wife and me to turn features on and off would be a revenue and income enhancer    mass customization has been possible for some time  and it would be a money maker bundling just pisses people off or puts them off spending    on the other hand bsw is one of those things that once you have it you cant imagine how you ever lived without it,markcincinnati
3987,August 2013,i hear what you are saying and it makes sense about the full packaged car with expandable options even after you leave the lot would like to see the software progdodge that includes wheel and tire sunroof seats suspension and other items thou the car makers will learn a lot about what tesla is doing with its customizable options and production line efficiency bsw seems like a good idea to be standard  but i wouldnt use it,sweendogy
3988,August 2013,at the risk of raising the ire of the moderator i am wondering not critically why you wouldnt use bsw to underscore the point i would assume you dont stick your arm out the window to indicate you are turning  you flick the turn signal stalk yes    my first experience with bsw was accidental  i ordered a new audi audi in 2008 with what was then the just announced prestige package bsw came standard as did a backup camera    i initially thought how lame  backup cameras are for minivans real men or women dont need no stinkin backup camera as i recall the default for bsw was to come on when you started the car like esp abs and auto for the audi drive select system  then you could punch a button to turn it off    after a few times of forgetting to turn it off i noticed that little amber stack of leds in the outboard mirror housing come on when there was no one or nothing around  you know i checked my mirrors well shut the front door  multiple times over the initial few months of having this excuse to charge more feature that i didnt even order i would see the light come on see nothing in any of my mirrors and just for the heck of it i would look over my shoulder and damn if there wasnt someone in my blind spot    in short i came to not only appreciate bsw i started to count the number of times the lights came on that i would have sworn no one was near me  just one time of ignoring those lights or god forbid not having them would have been at least a 4figure episode at a body shop or worse especially if it had been on the freeway    what i am saying is that i was past tense in the same place youre in when my new 2009 audi came in in october 2008 equipped with this who needs it piece of tech further i am suggesting that as perhaps stupid and simple as it may seem it is right up there with such things as sealed beam headlights turn signals brake lights backup cameras and holes in the roof    what once were vices  are now necessities    finally dont discount it until youve had it for a few months and find out that it has both a positive financial and safety feature    drive it like you live,markcincinnati

4025,September 2013,i test drove the car admittedly a sample of 1    it was brand new of course but it seemed like the computer wouldnt give me more than 205 hp even though i floored the son of a gun as i wasnt getting the oomph i was looking for the 305 horses were being lazy or the 8 speed auto was slushing the power drastically    either that or i got a lemon 350 f sport for my test drive    even with a better engine the car just didnt do enough for me handlingdrive wise    im spoiled by a dual clutch automanual transmission i cant see ever going back once you go dsg you are stuck  toy 16 audi tts audi awd commuter 17 volkswagen volkswagen alltrack se 4motion awd wifes 16 kia kia chrysler 16t fwd,andres3
4026,September 2013,so im sorry to hear the lexus has some flaws  im surprised a guy who just got an s4 would even bother wasting time not only yours but the dealers on such a car  certainly hearing about how good the s4 is and also how much of a good deal the audi was for you    the lexus prob slow due to standard backup camera or maybe it was a lexus also liked your commentary on the blue honda good choice,sweendogy
4027,September 2013,i think a proper comparo test done by more then one mag with all current contenders pulls more weight then the 15 min test drive you had with a salesmen sitting shot gun    one knows more about a fit to their own needs in one drive versus a pile of reviews    15 minutes is quite a bit of time to get a reliable impression,tlong
4028,September 2013,15 minutes is quite a bit of time to get a reliable impression    how can you compare 5 different cars side by side  without driving all side by side you cant 15 mins can get you comfortable with a car for sure,sweendogy
4029,September 2013,i drove the audi0s awd recently loved it the article from cd while disappointing wouldnt change my mind i was and continue to lament the apparent lack of marketing savvy infiniti has demonstrated regarding the audi0  but i will wait for another year to see how infiniti does under the watchful and experienced eye and hand of johan as we know  19 years at the helm of audi of america who does a great job typically of marketing across traditional and nontraditional media    because my wife and i have thus far kept to 3year leases and we drive over 18k miles per year it seems  almost literally  that one or the other of us is always shopping for a replacement car as one or the other is coming off lease hence we do tend to test drive as noted at least 10 times per year i completely understand if you are not in the market not wanting to test drive conversely as an enthusiast i would understand if someone test drove  on the proam circuit  24 times per year even if they werent in the market or in the mood so to speak    posting here and on audiworld for instance gets our my interest up so i am in the camp that favors staying on the hunt potato potaato kind of a thing    last night got to drive a loaded is 350 f sport    first impression for the price  better than the audi0s  first impression price be damned  still better than the audi0s    felt tighter more connected  heck it felt like a gokart it was so connected to the road turnin was sharper than a ken onion shun chefs knife  i am sure i could get used to it but in sport mode the thing dodgeed with only small steering wheel inputs    felt as if it were electric the power was so quick and smooth i only got it to about 65 mph    great sound system fantastic seats almost audi good in fact    not so sure why the pros say the dash is the first premium offering from any manufacturer to better an audi interior interior was nice but seemed like looking at a staircase instead of a flowing piece cut from a single piece    id put it on the list  cause at 49k including shipping this seems to be a better bang for the buck than either the audi sline or the audi0s    ive asked for a second long test drive  well see if it holds up to further inspection    drive it like you live    surprise,markcincinnati
4030,September 2013,24 times per year even if they werent in the market or in the mood so to speak    who has that kind of time even if you were in the market 24 times  thats crazy dealers must love you  yeah love the car have to wait a year still have 23 more test drives to make sure this is the one you and flight should car pool to these dealerships,sweendogy

4032,September 2013,we test about 10 cars per year escalating sometimes to 12 or 13  i never said we test drive 24 times annually although we have friends who are well heeled who seem to get a new car every spring whether they need one or not  meaning they test a lot    dealers  from our experience with premium brands that is  do seem to love having their cars test driven the chryslerjeep dealer on the other hand asks if youre going to buy today and if you dont give the answer they obviously want well see ya    friend of ours used to work at circuit city remember them and he told me that he had twominutes to spend with a customer and if there wasnt a clear indication that the person was going to buy today their mantra was whos next seems like the domestic auto dealers cadillac excluded all have this 2 minute mindset too    my wife ordered her new audi delivery estimated at 7590 days last week from a salesrep that has seen her smiling face numerous times over the last year and weve test driven everything but an r8 and an audi  talk about the patience of job but in the end she chose the 51k audi over similarly priced bmw volvos infinitis and mercedes benz    one point is or could be  no one buys a car without driving it hondaing to the rep so the more drives the reps have going on the more likely it is theyll have sales it is a numbers game even for premium autos or perhaps especially for the premium autos apparently    another point is and often is  folks baby boomers especially not so much millenials like or love cars like or love talking about them blogging about them and driving them so for some especially like my wife test driving serves a secondary purpose  its entertaining    the only time i wasnt entertained was when we took out a new lincoln  couldnt get back to the dealership fast enough    drive it    you know   ,markcincinnati
4033,September 2013,hell the infiniti dealer told me they have zero zip nada plans to even stock rwd audi0s  dealer trade or special order only for the rwd versions so yep we test drove a audi0sawd with every option except the tech package the package with the blind spot monitoring system the awd factoid should come as no shock especially since the 10th largest bmw stores sales manager told me well over 50 of the cars they sell are bmw    regarding bsm it seems like so many brands offer blind spot monitoring systems as a stand alone option usually around 500600  infiniti bundles it an a 3000 package of electronic nannies much as i like the audi0s awd i wouldnt get any new car without blind spot monitoring and i dont want my new car  yet if ever  to be able to drive itself and fight me whenever i try    so the audi0s awd is probably off the table  but i can be bought    the lexus is offers bsm for relatively cheap like audi and volvo to name two  so score another point for the is but the audi offers it stand alone too dont you know    the is 350 f sport i drove was rwd  the only one in cincinnati the only f sport so they claim i have already signed up to test the first awd version of an is 350 f sport once they come in i didnt even bother to get into a regular is 350 awd  although iss overall seem plentiful its just the f sports that are in short supply  which was blamed on the dealers procurement mgr hethey didnt think lexus customers would clamor for the sport version of anything  being that it is lexus  a sofa on wheels  after all    theres a new sheriff in town  and hisher badge has a stylized l on it look out bmw    drive it like you live,markcincinnati
4034,September 2013,well i was going to say an awd infiniti with allseason tires would be a real pig compared to a rwd lexus with summer rubber hard to make an applestoapples comparison    and ive got an awd infiniti and a bmw 3series with sport and summer rubber so i get to make that comparison almost every week  moderator    prices paid lease questions suvs,kyfdx

4037,September 2013,you and flight should car pool to these dealerships    funny you mention that was at the bmw dealer wed night drove a 320i since bmw is giving 2500k credit towards purchasing a 2013 3 series people criticize the 320i but as a occasional driver its not a bad car premium package sport package is 39950 costco auto progdodge 36750 so far give price of 35900 plus tax and lic this does not include the 2500 im going with the bmw select financing dont know if im going with the 48 or 60 month i was told bmw has a special rate with the 48 months but the sale manager has to get back with me    while at the dealership they have two 3 series gts have to say lots of room in it much more so then what i figured they also have 4 328ds didnt drive one i might tomorrow just to see what it drives like    sweeny its nice to sit at home and read car magazines and bench talk about cars however getting out and test driving them is a whole different story as mark stated the germans want to go for a test drive what i found is they want a stat a relationship with the client something that the domestic dealers lack and asians once you are in the fiance office its next the guy i deal with at bmw knows me he knows ill buy again and i am if i bought a ford i doubt that same sales person would be at the same dealer 6 months from now,flightnurse

4066,October 2013,first off congrats mark on the new purchases one question i was not aware that you can get any other color interior than black with the sport package every time i built an audi on line and choose the sport back the interior would default to black glad to know this isnt the case rick has been looking at a audi on line    now talking about new cars a couple of weeks back i had started talking with the bmw dealer about a purchase of a 320i then rick and i took off for new england and nyc for a week on my return we continued to talk more so friday i went to the dealership and finalized the deal it is jet black beige leather with premium package 8spd auto i made out pretty good 2k built credit 750 returning bmw owner 500 usaa  and 1k graduate money i used the costco purchase agreement which gave me the car 750 over invoice when it was all said and done otd price was 35275 i took the bmw select financing for 4 years it was nice to walk out with zero out of pocket i didnt want to lease the car as my payment would have been higher and rick would be using the car while im at work    drove the car up to kia that evening on this trip up and back averaged 336 not bad for a car with 47 miles when starting off speed was between 55 to 90 the higher speed was not intentional the car doesnt feel the speed as in my past bmw i wish i had the bmw assist but over on bimmerfest it seem that it can be added to the car    i have to say i really like the car yes it has elec steering but the only time you really know it is when you really push the car and on city streets one doesnt get to that limit so far i like the 8 spd auto when in sport mode the car up shift quickly and down shift just as fast now it just to learn all of the fun things that idrive does,flightnurse

4068,October 2013,graphic one unique thing really is ill be able to compare it to other cars ill be driving rentals more then my own car so far the 2014 chevrolet is my car of choice to rent i wish national would have tls but no dice plenty of infinitis though,flightnurse
4069,October 2013,fnseems as if most of the rentals ive been getting lately are mitsubishis huh  mitsu must have done a fleet dump of recent inventory    ive seen some of the newer chevrolets at the rental lots but i cant seem to snag one    would love to hear about the 320i as you get more seat time in it again congratz  2018 acura tchrysler sh awd aspec,graphicguy
4070,October 2013,both my wifes audi and my s4 came or will come from greg  the audi connection my wifes 2011 infiniti also came from another joseph dealership infiniti of cincinnati    dealing with these folks has always been a pleasure  and the audi club membership helped with the price on the s4 service departments at both audi and infiniti have been great too    we went ahead and got the audi care mntce progdodges  something missed on both the acura and the infiniti the premium cars we have had experience with are always very pricey to maintain  even the infiniti on the other hand the service departments at acura audi bmw and infiniti have always been delightful in terms of giving customers the red carpet treatment    we bought the audi and leased the s4 dont laugh but we have never purchased a car  it is scary since we have always felt that houses should be purchased and cars should be rented    those folks who have never leased probably dont get why we have some fear and trepidation about buying i guess it is like getting married vs living together buying seems like a commitment leasing not so much cars however are transitory ephemeral  so to us buying is a scary proposition    now the audi based on its anticipated depreciation is not as much of a financial risk as many cars are    well let you know how this venture into this new experience works out    dilyl,markcincinnati
4071,October 2013,graphic who do you rent through i only go through national since the company i work for has a contract with them two weeks ago i was in burlinpontiacnvt and rented a volvo volvo interesting suv no chevrolets but for the most part the bigger cities i arrive in have them now    ill write more on the 320 in the coming weeks i need some seat time in it ill be on the road for the next 13 days im paying for the 13 days i had off,flightnurse
4072,October 2013,i had a real estate agent once tell me that he never regretted or had buyers remorse with real estate since unlike cars they dont depreciate right away that was 2004    funny thing is i think my condo outdepreciated my car in ca    of course a home can last you 100 years you could depreciate the purchase over 100 years and the car perhaps only 1015 years  toy 16 audi tts audi awd commuter 17 volkswagen volkswagen alltrack se 4motion awd wifes 16 kia kia chrysler 16t fwd,andres3
4073,October 2013,mark i have to ask you this not that i am getting personal but dont you have around 18 months left on your tl lease  are you that unsatisfied with the car that you are willing to eat those 18 months of payments    secondly i disagree with your concepts of leasingbuying cars i will not get into the nuts and bolts of it i just disagree,billyperksii
4074,October 2013,the situation with the tl is that i have 10 months left on the lease at the leases conclusion my mileage situation means i would owe about 5000 to walk away from acura acura unlike infiniti doesnt allow you to buy miles at lease inception at a discount my wife bought 18k miles per year on her lease i couldnt do that    my tl is an shawd advance  and after detailing it last week it looks nearly new using three websites plus carfax i was able to determine that to abandon my lease will cost less than 2k today    so i am going to be dingd  a little now vs a lot then my plan at this point is to consider buying the s4 off lease i will have first right of refusal with a cpo warranty and audi care to 100000 miles audi does allow the purchase of additional miles after lease inception but before the last 6 months of the lease    as noted were thinking buying should not be completely discounted  so were taking the buy one rent one and possibly buy later approach since weve no experience with buying a car and find the concept almost foreign    so yep terminating the lease early will cost me but not nearly as much as going to full term    your mileage may differ    dilyl,markcincinnati

4080,October 2013,the audi prestige and acura advance pose at least one question i intellectually understand but just dont seem right    the prestige and advance configurations from audi and acura seem to me to be a way to bundle virtually everything into one package indeed the acura advance has no options that can be had the advance over the technology package version adds 19 wheels heated and ventilated seats and blind spot monitoring    the prestige audi adds a number of extras on top of the next lower configuration premium and seems to offer the buyer a slightly better deal when purchased as part of the prestige package although in the case of audi it is possible to add most of the prestige features for extra cost of course to the premium in other words if you wanted blind spot monitoring you can tick off that option on a premium version for 500 and not get the navigation system which comes standard with the prestige version    ok now that i have tap danced around your question ill mention that the top of the line configurations have lower residuals than the middle children    we configured my wifes audi and my s4 by building up premium models to have most of the prestiges features which actually means that our residual  on premium is higher than the maxed out contented prestige models    you may wonder why we researched the residual of the audi since we are buying it  but the reason to know the residual has to do with knowing at least the possible value of the depreciating asset at various times during the financing contract in other words knowing the residual does allow us to have an understanding of when the car is no longer upside down with the s4 the residual is important for obvious reasons since it is leased the s4 p has an attractive residual indeed which is of course a double edged sword    the higher residual lowers the mopay but also raises the cost of buying the car off lease should we decide to go that route    now to answer your question    my 2012 acura tl shawd advance has a  residual  amt  2450985    the msrp was  4716630 52 residual in other words    dilyl,markcincinnati
4081,October 2013,i wonder if you actually have oil monitor or its just a software im not aware of any manufacturer having a real oild quality sensors there from what i heard and read its all calculated based on driving but i may be wrong    btw i my over the year comment was directed to bmw not acura when i wrote you i meant one who owns bmw not you bmwuser owner of acura sorry for the misunderstanding  2018 430i gran coupe,dino001
4082,October 2013,no problem i understood just stating the obvious i guess i really have no idea how the oil monitor works in the acura and it really doesnt matter all that much to me i would get the oil changed at one year or about 7500 regardless of what the oil monitor or the owners manual said unless of course the owners manual was even more stringent,m6user
4083,October 2013,you guys peaked my interest since one of the local mercedes benz dealers is close to my home i wandered over there last night to look at the cla they had 2 of them they said they initially had 4 but already sold two one was 38k msrp it didnt have leather nor the fancy diamond grill you see in the tv ads its an option    they wanted me to do a test drive i declined for nearly 40k i think ill pass you can get a nice audi for that moneyor an atsor a 320iall of which i think are nicer vehicles heckyou can get a loaded up acura acura for less than that or in reality a infinitix is selling for less than that these days just a hunch but id say any of the above would be better cars than the cla    no doubt theyll sell a lot of themat least initially i think those of us who fall on the sports side of luxury sport vehicles would be disappointed though just one mans opinion    side noteedmunds forums flaky for anyone else  2018 acura tchrysler sh awd aspec,graphicguy
4084,October 2013,bmwi pulled this out of my old file when i had my tl a few years ago this is what acura stated about the oil life monitor    the tl has a maintenance minder system that automatically monitors the vehicles unique operating condition to indicate to the driver when maintenance is required maintenance alerts are presented when the ignition is first turned on not while driving to prevent driver distraction the system monitors engine operating conditions such as fluid temperatures and engine speed to determine the proper service intervals the multiinfo display mid located below the fuel and engine temperature gauges in the instrument cluster indicates the remaining percentage of engine oil life and then shows service is due with a wrench icon a percentagebased countdown to the next service is displayed when the car is within 15 percent of the end of the service interval a letter and number code is displayed to indicate the specific type of service that is required if the service is missed the mid indicates pastdue mileage to chevrolet the urgency of the required service to the driver    the system is designed to eliminate unnecessary maintenance procedures environmental impact and expenses while ensuring that important service issues are addressed in some cases oil change intervals can extend to a maximum of 10000 miles which could spare the owner considerable money and inconvenience over the life of the car the ownerresettable system monitors all normal service parts and systems including oil oil filter tire rotation aircleaner automatic transmission fluid chevrolet plugs timing belt coolant brake pads and more    thinking back to when the manufacturers stated oil change intervals based on mileage alone i think the monitors might give a more accurate guesstimate on when your oil is depleted    i remember a mechanic friend who i would consult in my younger days of building a money pit track car telling me he could tell if the oil was depleted just by smell and by rubbing the dip stick in between his fingers i was amazed at that until i realized all he was doing was feeling for grit in the oil and trying to determine if the oil smelled burnt not very scientific of course we didnt use synth oil either  2018 acura tchrysler sh awd aspec,graphicguy
4085,October 2013,no doubt theyll sell a lot of themat least initially i think those of us who fall on the sports side of luxury sport vehicles would be disappointed though just one mans opinion    graphicguy  i went to the local mb dealer a couple of weeks ago to take a closer look at the cla you would have thought that a kardashian kid had showed up there were so many people surrounding the car    like you noticed the two they had on the lot were stickered in the 3638k range quite a bit of money for what is a pretty small car i guess everyone wants to play in the compact luxury arena these days    i agree with you  those people wanting something sporty will probably shop elsewhere 320i audi ats would be good alternatives    where it gets tricky is that you can option up some more pedestrian brands to that mid 30s price range  kia honda ford  and get way more features for the money and save money on maintenance and perhaps get a better warranty    bottom line is that the lines are beginning to blur on the luxury side of the equation  moderator    2016 volkswagen volkswagen 14t se  2015 subaru subaru 36r  2014 mini countryman s all4    need help navigating michaelledmundscom  or send a private message by hyundaiing on my name    share your vehicle reviews,Michaell

4092,October 2013,im guessing the oil monitor works based on temps driving style whether it is stop and go traffic or highway the speed in which one drives throttle position and over all how one drives the car it would be interesting experiment to take two identical cars drive one how normal people would drive and then take one and drive it hard take it on the track and see if the oil monitor stays anything different and if the one who drives the car harder would have to come in for service sooner or does it matter with the new synthetic oils how hard or easy you drive the car,flightnurse

4105,October 2013,quick take 2014 s4 stronic 333 hp 325 lb ft    there must be some reason that audi would understate the power of one or more for all i know of their engines maybe it is a tax thing in germany whatever the reason it seems to me that there is no way this car has only 333 hp and 325 lb ft    i had heard that the 20ts power as it stands in the current audi is understated and i have driven the car and it does seem impossible that it is 220 hp motivating a car that big and i read a test report of the s8 that wagged its finger at audi for understating that engine too so i guess it must be an audi practice to underrate their engines    of course other than for tax reasons if that really is true why would they do this i recall that acura and others had to restate the power of the rls 37l v6 to less than 300 hp suggesting to me that most car companies would probably like to find a way to overstate the power numbers hp measured at sea level on a cold day for instance    in any case even with less than 1000 miles on it the s4 seems to have great surprising reserves of power  perhaps sports car power an rs version must be dangerous if this s version is any indication    once again i find myself wondering why the recent spate of car magazine sport sedan comparos doesnt include this car,markcincinnati
4106,October 2013,mark when it comes to hp the germans have always done it different if you take the bmw bmw the car makes 300hp and 300 lbs of torque however ifyou look at the times it run there is no way that a 300hp car can run that fast and dyno test have proven over and over again that it makes more power also the 7 spd dsg helps too i also believe that engines today make power more efficiently then before my 320i only makes 180hp and 200lbs of torque but the passing on the highway is effortless,flightnurse
4107,October 2013,as for why the magazines arent testing the s4 with the others it may have lost a comparision test with one of the others in the past i am not sure how old the current as4 is also the may be justifying it by testing rwd performance sedans maybe they will do an awd test later  not saying it is right but might be their thinking i think generally the first answer is the reason  same reason the cclass isnt in the tests that said i am sure the as4 is right up there with the others and depending on what you are looking for may be the best,scwmcan

4116,December 2013,marki replied privately at least thats what i thought with the new forums now in place  dont get me wrong i think the s4 is one of the best 4 door sports sedans on the market regardless of price but mine has been very trouble prone its sitting at the dealership yet again right now  the chicago regional rep took over communications from the dealer i purchased it from and hes supposed to be in communication with the local dealer i think the local dealer is just as frustrated with the local audi regional rep as i am  were well over the 30 day rule of the car being out of commission so i think theyre all huddling trying to decide the next step to take  ill wait to see what they do so far everyone except the local audi regional rep have been great to work with  i think i know which diretion this will end up but you never know that said if they do end up lemon lawing my car ill obviously be in a scdodgeble to get something else what that is i really dont know  rayi do like that 235i m but i doubt that will be in my time bracket if they do a buy back  i may make a little trip around this weekend looking at different cars just for kicks  2018 acura tchrysler sh awd aspec,graphicguy
4117,December 2013,i have in this forum shared my experiences with my 2012 acura tl shawd advance i did suggest that i understood and largely agreed with the july 10 automobile comparison of a tl shawd with an audi s4 with the sport differential – audis torque vectoring rear diff  refresher from automobile july 2010 “you probably never thought of the acura tl shawd and the audi s4 on the same day much less in the same sentence   significantly they both use torquevectoring allwheeldrive systems to ensure that they dont sacrifice one iota of the cornercarving thrills youve grown to love”  “in a nonpermissible content removedfortat comparison between two cars that share the same driveline philosophy it quickly becomes obvious that the acura and the audi are significantly different only in the details”  now with 3000 miles on my 14 s4 and after 40000 miles with my tl i can offer my 2¢ more  first let’s get the “as owned “ msrp’s out there with rear parking sensors upgraded tires uhp ass and suzuki guards the tl shawd advance comes in a bit south of 48000 approximately comparably equipped but sans the sport differential the s4 premium easily sweeps past 57000 coming in at 57650 without premium paint which could have added additional  had i selected one of the many optional colors offered my 12 acura came with the color called bellanova white pearl while the audi i configured was in a glossy hue they call ibis white a metallic white option on the audi would have added another 550 to the msrp  if you’re keeping score the audi starts out about 10000 more than the acura similarly contented but simply saying they have similar content somehow makes the audi seem expensive a perspective i have come to believe is untrue as the automobile review declares “they are significantly different only in the details” never a truer statement was said about these two cars and please don’t for a minute think that somehow this is a knock on the acura  indeed considering its performance  content the tl shawd advance is rather a bargain and i mean what i say only about the shawd advance version – what i say should not suggest i would make these remarks about other tl configurations perhaps were i given the opportunity to test a tl with both shawd and the manual transmission i would change my opinion  the audi is neither overpriced nor is it a bargain – but considering its price it is unlikely you will find the s4’s luxury content and performance envelope replicated without spending thousands more the current heartthrob car the lexus is 350 fsport offers a very high contented audaciously styled machine to be sure but its performance isn’t up to the s4’s in fairness however an fsport even over loaded with optional stuff will have trouble breaking the 50000 msrp barrier  there is currently no bmw 3series m car if you don’t include the 3series” m” convertible starting at 69050 which i am not counting – and if there were it too would easily sail through a 65000 price besides the comparison to the s4 would be incorrect the bmw m would be more accurately compared to an rs – not s – audi car  back to the tl vs the s4 both cars do what they do well – at their respective price points the acura – subjectively – may well representpossess over 90 of the audi’s performance and for the money asked the acura remains perhaps one of the biggest bargains today in the ellps category assuming you can get over the exterior – and for some the interior – styling  here is what you get for your extra 10000 in the audi s4 a palpable sense that anything and everything you want the car to do is effortless from the stronic’s apparent ability to read the driver’s mind to an incredibly deep bucketful of power that is always ready a ¼ of a second before you ask for it to an ability to corner that approaches violating the laws of physics the s4 almost becomes an extension of the driver’s mind rather like green lantern’s powerring i suspect  in contrast the tl shawd is not quite as much the natural athlete as the s4 – although it has nothing to be ashamed of it’s just that to get 90 of the s4’s performance out of the tl you have to work at it here’s one reason why the tl’s well of torque isn’t as deep as the audi’s and the tl’s torque doesn’t reach fullboil until significantly higher rpm’s the tls v6 is naturally aspirated vs the s4s supercharged v6 the consequences of less torque attained at higher rpm’s twisting through 6 automatic gears are not subtle – the acura must be kept “cranked up” to get the most out of it while doing this can be pretty rewarding it is hardly effortless  another huge disadvantage the tl has is its 6 speed traditional it uses a torque converter automatic transmission the audi’s 7speed direct shift twinclutch transmission by comparison feels as if the smoothest stick shift driver ever is selecting the perfect time for upshifts and downshifts coming to a stop the audi’s transmission downshifts both at the appropriate time but also with incredible precision and smoothness that i doubt any one of us contributors here could even come close to  in the final analysis the 2012 tl shawd advance is a lot of car for the money – and i would still call it acura’s s4 for 47000 there isn’t much – if anything – that comes close to the content and performance offered if you can get past its unique styling and busy buttonladen cockpit i had mine 40000 miles over less than a 30 month time period and other than what i assumed were weak brakes the rotors were turned twice before 25k miles before the dealer determined the problem was three warped wheels which acura replaced – at a 50 discount to me the acura would certainly seem to be well on its way to living up to its reputation for reliability – but at only 40000 miles i assume most cars on the market today would still seem young  the 2014 s4 presumably produces performance numbers that bests the tl in almost every category but for an additional 10000 it ought to the s4 does seem more substantive than the tl – of course you only really notice this aspect when you slam the doors or hit a pothole or find yourself on a “washboard” road surface the acura’s body seems to be of a thinner metal than the audi the tls suspension upon rapid compression or over undulating surfaces seems on the verge of being brittle where the audi under similar circumstances seems to absorb and rebound from rough surfaces with aplomb  if you’re looking for the tl to buy you much – if any – street cred from your buds don’t count on it virtually everyone i know called my tl “mark’s honda” truth be told the main problem with the acura – for me – was that it simply had “too much honda” in it some years ago audis were sometimes said to have “too much volkswagen” in them – regardless of the truth the perception was sufficient apparently to motivate audi to separate themselves as much as they could from volkswagen thus far acura’s are often thought of as “honda’s who know somebody”  more’s the pity for the tl at least is a kind of “almost” car – it is almost many things almost a luxury car almost a sporty car – ie almost an lps car i can recommend the tl shawd advance for its likely street price i got mine at nearly 13 off the car is comfortable well contented and highly competent at most if not all of the things we ask for in a premium vehicle  it didn’t inspire much passion and frankly didn’t seem to actually have been built to be passionate the s4 inspires and it has passion – its “fun to drive factor” which seems to be priced at about 10000 has been abundantly imbued by its creators even after a crappy day driving the s4 puts a smile on my face  that’s my story    and   you know  dilyl,markcincinnati
4118,December 2013,infiniti has done many many things to destroy its bread and butter  the awesome infiniti  with the new audi0 the list of things is endless from destroying what was likely the best handling vehicle in its class to a ridiculous dual touchscreen interior  for the sake of argument let us say there was some logic behind those moves  some new audience that subaru g drivers like me and almost all reviewers do not understand  but can anyone explain why infiniti felt the need to dump the gs trademark doublecircular taillight arrangement to replicate the taillights of the hyundai was it their way of going upscale  hyundai  audi0,hercules00
4119,December 2013,i dont know i dont see it that way to me the audi0 looks more updated and upscale the g although handsome was getting old,carnaught
4120,December 2013,i agree with the comments about the beauty of the new audi0 i think it is very handsome on the outside and both inside and out it seems more upscale befitting its inclusion with its competition from audi bmw cadillac lexus  mercedes benz to name a few  the issues with the audi0 seem not to be with its comeliness rather with its steering feel or lack thereof other critiques seem to remind the reader that the 37l normally aspirated engine  while somewhat more sound isolated in the audi0  is coarse and that the 7speed transmission is a carryover  now having just turned in our 2011 infiniti after 60000 miles i would say even if there were no improvements in the transmission in the audi0 that it is a fine transmission likewise the 37l engine is powerful even if not particularly blessed with an abundance of torque after driving the new audi0 the thrash and coarseness often attributed to this engine has been muted significantly but this mill isnt up to the smoothness of the german 6cylinder engines and one wonders why infiniti hasnt noticed apparently that forced induction engines are the currently favored configuration  overall the infiniti at least this first venture out with the new audi0 seems unlikely to be finishing as the top choice against its german and japanese competitors i assume infiniti was shooting to be the darling of the ellps set but came up short compared to the lexus is 350 f sport especially  from a styling perspective i find the audi0 to be handsome it looks expensive the is 350 is well edgy with its audacious styling and spindle grill the is looks like it would be sporty to me at least whereas the audi0s style might well be more enduring since  compared to the is  it is more conservative less inyourface heres something too the ats  right out of the gate  seems to have gotten a lot more right than the audi0 despite what many could have assumed was a headstart what with the audi0 coming from such good stock the infinitix  now at least here in cincinnati the audi0 seems to be subvented and discounted so heavily that they ought to be flying out of the showroom i have never seen one on the road other than near the dealership where they are obviously being testdriven  this is pretty amazing considering that i have seen the outrageously priced audi rs 7  a car so rarified that i actually wouldnt consider not seeing it as indicative of anything not once seeing a audi0 is  speaking as a fan of the brand  well sad  hopefully johan de nysschen the new infiniti president will be able to imbue future infinitis with some of the audi magic he most certainly picked up on over his 19 years with audi  well theres always next year  id look for some underthecovers changes for the audi0 sooner rather than later but i could be wrong just not uncertain  dilyl,markcincinnati

4123,December 2013,i nearly cracked up when i read your comment cd that my wife and i were slumming with her infiniti and my acura i guess your equating both our return to audis or german cars in general to the economy is perhaps somewhat or more than somewhat true too  yet to be more transparent i think it is also acccurate to say that the japanese cars we had were quoting my wife passionless even though they were worthy of being described as premium class  i had so wanted the audi0 to be what its advanced press promised and if youll recall i custom ordered an is 350 f sport in ultra white with a red leather interior awd and a bunch of options when my wife ordered a audi 30t i tes drove the s4 and thought it to be beyond reach even though it was clearly able to outperform the is in every way including price  the audi dealer somehow came up with a lease price that made switching my plans and coming home to audi a no brainer so yea the economy observation does ring true but not the whole story  regarding the length of my posts well i once again have something to go on about  i do urge anyone even thinking about the cars under discussion here to include a test drive of an s4 you may find as did i that an s4 is within reach  until next time drive it like you live,markcincinnati

4126,January 2014,someone asked for a comparecontrast with the new tl sh awd and the previous one i had in addition to a comparison to the s4 i just cant remember which thread asked for the post so putting it here  ill get this out of the way up front so markincincinnati doesnt raise his blood pressure the s4 drives better no question in some areas its significantly better in other areas just a smidgeon better then there are areas where the tl sh awd is better  first the difference between my former 4g tl sha awd and this one the new one is smoother theres no trans shifting feeling going on my old one had the 5 speed auto the new one a 6 speed i think the ratios are closer together which might account for the smoothness and i believe the 6th gear has a taller ratio than the old one one tank of gas in 5050 driving i got 23 mpg plenty acceptable thats about 10 better than the old tl and about the same amount better than the s4  so i like the new trans in the tl its not as good as the dsg 7 speed in the s4 but it is better than the one in the previous again smooth with good manual control via the paddle shifters the s4 will bang gears with the best of them automatic or manual no ifs ands or buts  the s4 is fast without a doubt its probably the fastest sports sedan ive ever driven and will rival many muscle cars the tl is quick it has plenty of power especially once you get around the 3k rpm range where the torque kicks in the s4 has torque all over the range rev the new 6 speed in the tl makes it feel quicker than the old one again different gear ratios  handlingthe tl is fwd based even though it has the torque vectoring tick going on as did the s4 so there is a difference between the s4 and the sh awd of the tl not as much as you might expect though theyre really close in the handling dept i find myself sometimes saying i liked the s4 better at other times i find myself saying the tl sh awd is as good as the s4 and also more forgiving tough to choose one over the other  ridethis goes to the new tl i think acura has out bmwd bmw with the ridehandling compromise acura must have recalibrated the suspension in some way its firm without being uncomfortable where the s4 sometimes crashes over bumps in the road the tl absorbs them without ddodgea  seat comfort goes to the tl they were and continue to be some of the best sports seats in any car ive ever driven theyre snug without pinching something the s4s seats sometimes do  fit and finish is a tie the old tl the new tl and the s4 are all exemplary in fit and finish however as with the old tl everything in the new tl just works the way its supposed to thats a far cry from what i experienced with the s4 all electronics work theres no in car internet in the tl but i let the uber expensive in car internet lapse in the s because it was slow and unneeded since i did let it lapse in the s4 some of the nav maps went bonkers next to no information about the roads being displayed on the nav on the tl its straight forward accurate and detailed  as good as the bo stereo was in the s4 the system in the tl els is better its simply one of the best factory sound systems on the market in any car  styling as always is subjective i liked the look of the older tl i like the look of my new one better im way in the minority here though the s4 is classic audi with the lcd daytime running lights that everyone seems to like these days i liked the look of the s4 too  heres where markincinnati and i will part i had the check from audi buying back my s4 i pocketed around 14k and got the new tl sh awd advanceas loaded as you can get one  is the s4 better as i started some ways yes other ways no is it 14k better not even closenot even 10k better and id have to try really really hard to make a case that its 5k better  dont get me wrong both are really good cars if youre looking to blow peoples doors off at stop lights while having a good handling 4 door the s4 is for you  if you want something more well rounded that does a lot of things well the tl is for you just dont go seeking any ford gts down at a stop lightwait until you get into the corners  2018 acura tchrysler sh awd aspec,graphicguy

4130,January 2014,graphicguy  when i first came to the economic realization in 2011 that i would feel the prudent choice for my next car out of a 2009 audi audi prestige would not be another audi a new audi to replace the 09 would have been about 100 more per month and the lease term 6 months longer i tested many brands  the 2012 acura tl shawd advance seemed like a good choice since it most reminded me of an audi and specifically it reminded me more of an s4 than an audi 20t with sport package i had read a 2010 automobile magazine comparison report of the s4 and tl which did say most folks would probably never cross shop the two cars but overall the tl shawd was favorably reviewed even though it was outgunned and outpriced by the s4  i find myself more in violent agreement with your thoughts than any other perspective your recent experience with an s4 certainly has made you come by your observations and opinions honestly indeed your overview was balanced  the most subjective part of many purchases we make is typically value  some folks will value an extra 10 sufficiently to allow them to costjustify a 25 or more in some cases price difference this is true in cars clothes food and seat choices at sporting events to name just a few  the s4s creators as i noted seems to cost funtodrive at about 10000 over the tl shawd advance today i see the s4 as being worth the premium in 2011 i could not costjustify such a price delta  bang for the buck does go to the acura i am thinking too that there are other high bang for the buck offerings available from korea  at the same time i am also thinking the new cadillac cts is a lower value proposition than the previous generation cts clearly these preferences are highly subjective  objectively or as objectively as possible the acura can be evaluated as having greater content per dollar than the audi although more subjective in nature i believe it is probable that any collection of professional reviewers opinions about the two cars would reveal these reviewers to find the s4 more praiseworthy objective measured test results too would probably show the audis performance to be higher than the acuras  even if often only slightly thus  it all comes down to how much it is worth to you to have one vs the other no such comparison is possible given the 5figure price difference between the two vehicles but i wonder which car would be chosen if they were priced virtually identically and identically contented  i assume if the choice of a new loaded tl shawd or a new loaded s4 were presented and both had an asking price of 47500 that the s4 would be chosen more frequently the vast majority of the time  cant prove this of course but it would make for an interesting study of perceived value  today therefore ill agree that the tl shawd advance offers a very high value but i will also  today  pay the upcharge for the s4 and attribute that price difference to the cost of the funtodrive factor  dilyl  with the emphasis on you,markcincinnati
4131,January 2014,markas alwaysappreciate your honda  at the end of the day thats the reason there are so many choices particularly in the ellps sliver of the market  competition keeps all of these vehicles we discuss smack in the middle of what i consider some of the most desireable cars on the road they are certainly among the most capable cars you can driveprobably in any of the individual brands line up  long and short of it theres no wrong answer here  since im fresh off of test drives its clear where some of these manufacturers are going bmw for reasons that befuddle me are softening up their cars i suspect most will like that personally i dont but looks like its helping them sell more cars same can be said for the infiniti q although that softening doesnt seem to be helping them whatsoever in selling the new audi0 shame  mercedes benz is going for high style i saw pics of the new c class and drove the cla im guessing the new c will drive similarly to the old c nothing compelling there cla shows mercedes benz trying to become the style leader while offering run of the mill driving dynamics seems to be working for them as they just surpassed bmw as the us luxury car sales leader not my cup o tea but theyve been successful with that strategy  audi keeps marching to their own beat good for them for doing it to me they are the performance leaders owning the s4 and having had audis for extended periods of time as loaners i cant fathom another manufacturer doing more to imbue their cars with fun to drive characteristics reliability needs lots of work though  if theres one place acura has fallen down its in the style dept theyve got the engineering down their performance is competitive their operation build and reliability are rock solid i dont hold out much hope that the upcoming tchrysler will be substantially different from the acura is style i like it most dont that said it does feel good to just have such a capable car do everything well without worry of hiccups  wish i could think of a pithy saying to close with cant so thanks for the inputwill have to suffice  2018 acura tchrysler sh awd aspec,graphicguy

4149,January 2014,id bet acura wants to get the tchrysler to dealers very soon  however there will have to be a bit of a balancing act in that the current tl inventory will have to be taken into consideration so that the new tchrysler doesnt force the 2014 tl to be discounted until it hurts  my audi dealer says that based on current inventory it is now typical for the new cars without owners names attached already to be held in port whilst the current inventory is worked down  i guess we should appreciate that approach if we are already owners since it would seem to help preserve somewhat the value of the current model  i remember when i could go into a dealership and there would be plenty of leftover last year models gathering dust until the deep discounting started them moving again dont see that so much anymore  im gonna forecast the tchrysler will fare better with the pro reviewers and enthusiasts magazines than did the audi0 from infiniti  been wrong before  dilyl,markcincinnati

4163,January 2014,thinking back about msds i should have taken the equity from my acura and paid as many msds as i could to both lower the payment and get the cash back at the end of the lease september problem is that the dealer that i bought from who gave me the best price for my bmw and my trade is in ny a state that does not allow the use of msds instead i used the equity plus my 500 bmwcca rebate to pay up front fees acquisition dmv plus my 1st 9 lease payments if i would have bought the car where i live in ct i could have paid msds up front who knows they might not have given me as much for my trade and hit me with a 499 doc fee thinking about it now that would have been a better use of the free money now i know for next time  2001 prelude type sh 2015 infiniti q40 awd 2017 honda honda touring awd,nyccarguy
4164,January 2014,robsubaru  you are right they might not have the 5k to lay out for msds but theyll put down 2995 as a cap cost reduction not realizing that if their car gets stolen or totaled at any point during the lease they loose that money  2001 prelude type sh 2015 infiniti q40 awd 2017 honda honda touring awd,nyccarguy

4167,January 2014,flightnurse  i do truly love the way my car drives to put it simply it is the car that ill look to compare every other it is the 1st but dont think it will be the last e90 i own im definitely not going to buy the lease out because the residual is too high and ill have somewhere in the neighborhood of 50000 miles on it when the lease is up at the end of september im going to go for something less expensive for the time being ill lease something like an honda or subaru subaru 5 door and share it with my wife for 15k per year when she drives the new car ill drive her honda or my prelude when the weather is nice once my bmw lease is up ill only have 18 months left to pay off the honda i might be able to pay the honda off a little earlier too 1 car payment would be nice  2001 prelude type sh 2015 infiniti q40 awd 2017 honda honda touring awd,nyccarguy

4170,January 2014,regarding the statements  bmw probably does the most to subsidize their leases i think mercedes benz does too and i wouldnt call it subsidizes they have progdodges  well the truth of the matter is that bmw among others does provide financial support for leases made through their financial companies this support is often usually called a subvented lease  subventing makes leasing more attractive to the buyer who doesnt care so much about the msrp of a given vehicle but does care about the monthly payment either a purchase or a lease deal can be subvented  but the real impact of subventing is going to be able to be much greater for a lease than a loan  the best thing that can be done regarding a loan to buy a new car is that the interest rate charged can be set to zero 0 apr this way a 36000 car can be purchased and the payments determined by dividing 36000 by the number of months that payments will be made 36000 divided by 36 months then equals doh a 1000 per month payment  i assume we could stretch the point and say that the manufacturer could offer a loyalty or conquest or even a just because bonus or rebate or discount of 1000 making the amount financed be only 35000 meaning the payment would be 35000 divided by 36 months or 97222month  a subvented lease on the other hand is where the mfg can really influence your purchase decision heres why  when you lease a new car the payment will be determined generally speaking by several things  1the  of value residual value that the car will have at the end of the lease  2the money factor think of it as the interest rate that is used  roughly speaking you can calculate the lease payment remember the word roughly by subtracting the residual value from the msrp of the car to get your anticipated usage cost  if the car is 36000 and its residual is 50 your usage over 36 months is 18000 if you put money out of your pocket as what you might term a down payment you will reduce the amount of the agreement by that amount this is called a capitalized cost reduction  this down payment in your mind does not reduce the residual value of the car meaning that if you decided to buy the car at the end of the lease the amount you will have to come up with will still be 18000 please dont call any money down on a conventional closedend lease a down payment and i wont either it is a cap cost reduction  and the purpose of this cap cost reduction is solely to reduce the monthly payment you are not building up any value post lease whatsoever  the money factor or the implied cost of money  or interest rate is applied to recognize the value of the time you have the auto mfgs finance arms money tied up  far more detailed explanations  and explanations that are specific to your lease deal  are available here on edmunds and of course at your dealership  the bottom line however is this the auto manufacturers financial outlet may offer a lease to you that has been subvented by the manufacturer the subventing can take the form of  a reduction of the money factor  including taking it to zero or  an increase of the residual   including taking it to a very optimistic  5 or even more  meaning the car will be said to be worth a much larger percentage of its brand new value than market conditions would likely support  this manipulation of the residual cannot be done when the car is financed outright  so perhaps you can see that a subvented lease could produce a very very low monthly payment if the mfg decides to reduce the money factor to zero or near zero and increases the residual value significantly over the expected depreciation  subvented leases often carry with them terms that are not as friendly to you as a straight buy with a loan or a lease that has not been subvented  if the manufacturer says the residual is 62 after 36 months and the reality of the situation is that the 36 month value should only be 55 you may not be able to get out of your lease early without a huge  penalty plus perhaps a standalone early termination fee or penalty  if you buy and finance a car you can sell or trade you car almost at any time and only pay the potential difference between the outstanding loan amount and the amount you can sell the car for it may feel like a prepayment penalty but the reality is that there will be no literal prepayment penalty it is uncommon for an auto loan from a bank for instance to have a prepayment penalty  if you want to get out of the loan you can sell the car and give the proceeds to the bank plus a bit more out of your pocket or perhaps a check from the bank  so leases give leases take leases are sometimes of the very very low payment variety  meaning there is some subventing going on and suggesting that youd better be prepared to not fall out of love with your new baby for about 90 of the leases term i say that because it is also common practice to put customers in 39 month leases and then around month 33 start to seduce owners into the showrooms with the promise of letting them out of their leases without penalties if they release the new model  bmw does have a reputation  i assume well founded  for supporting subventing leases this can make getting into a 50000 bimmer within reach it also pretty much locks customers into the cycle of lease burn through the lease and release again and again  nothing wrong with that for a lot of consumers but not for all  if you want to keep your car 5 years or longer you may not find leasing economics works for you  if you drive more than 18000 miles per year and probably the message could be more than 15000 miles per year you may not find leasing economics works for you as your residual will likely drop sharply meaning the monthly payment will rise sharply in response  if you own a business on the other hand leasing may mean you can expense your lease payment to the company with proper and available proof which many would consider to be a good thing  if you want to build equity in your car well that is highly or at least fairly unlikely in a leased car but more likely in a car that you are making payments on to buy  and the pros of leasing and buying go on  neither my wife nor i had ever purchased a car until late 2013 when we bought her 14 audi saudi prestige we also lease a 14 audi s4 and are fully intending 4 months into the lease to buy the thing at the end of the lease  and we put no money down on the lease this is a new experience for us and we keep rationalizing that  at this time  buying for us will likely turn out to be a better deal since we intend on keeping the cars more than 5 years  so my point in all that is above is this auto manufacturers do indeed provide financial subsidies ie named subvented lease progdodges multiple security deposits are not strictly speaking subsidies however  dilyl,markcincinnati

4189,February 2014,5000 miles down the road  a friend of mine a marketing executive for a national software firm always buys bmw’s and claims audis are exclusively for “leftbrainers” i started out life as a computer progdodgemer so maybe there is something to that because they appeal to technical types techweenies to quote my friend you know these folks those people who not only can create elaborate spreadsheets with impossible formulas but also who can write actual computer progdodges as well my wiseguy friend claims even though audi engines transmissions and sumptuous interiors are either proclaimed by the motoring press to be “the best” or at least “tied for the top” audis remain soulless machines sorely lacking the allimportant emotional hook to keep “serious” car people interested and perhaps entertained they audis are extremely competent and confidence inspiring pieces of machinery but they somehow are not the stuff that inspires passionate prose – even though they are often the winners of three four and fiveway motoring press “comparo” reports  although i apparently am in the minority who do not doubt audi’s soul can be seen heard and felt in its cars i now present an s4 update now that i have passed 5000 miles – much of it being driven in subfreezing weather and on snow and icecovered roads  the audi in question is an ibis white 2014 s4 premium plus model with the 7speed stronic transmission 18” wheels shod with allseason tires mminavigation bo audio magma red napa leather seats carbon fiber trim audi side assist and audi care i guess perhaps i even wish i would have gone for the prestige model now that i think of it just for the articulating headlights of course now that i know how inexpensive the sport differential is i should have insisted on getting that too with shipping and audi care the pretax price was 57k as a member of the audi club of north america i got an “automatic” 6 off the sticker and as an ohio resident had to pay 65 sales tax i put no money down and leased the car i plan to buy the car and the audi extended service package if it proves itself to be as durable as it is fun to drive i believe there is a way too to cpo my own car for a price giving me a warranty to 100000 miles  at 5000 miles the first service – basically an inspection and an oil and filter change – is required subsequent service intervals are 10000 miles  first off the car has had no issues of any kind beyond a flat tire which only required a patch to remedy even on the coldest mornings minus 11 f starting was no problem and since i have heated seats there was only shortlived temperature discomfort my butt was quickly warmed up that is  second the s4 with the stronic transmission is beyond a pleasure to drive – it goes all the way to fun to drive coupled with a boatload of confidence inspiration the engine transmission brake and steering combination work together so well they have convinced me they are telepathic responding to my foot and hand commands in real time there is no latency press the accelerator and the car doesn’t pause that millisecond every other car i have ever had did indeed it seems to accelerate almost a millisecond before my brain receives the confirmation from my foot that the pedal has been pressed the paddle shifters too act they don’t react – when i ask for an upshift the speed at which the next highest gear is selected is faster and smoother even than the best manual transmission upshift i could ever pull off and i should also tell you that the brakes slow or stop the car with such speed and control it is as if i had hit a giant superthick foam rubber wall finally the s4 goes where you point it when you point it body roll is minimal and it corners like a ken onion chef’s knife carves a tender beef roast  other than the unabashed fartlike exhaust sound that accompanies high rpm upshifts the s4 is very quiet and civilized inside and the tuneage delivered through the bo speaker system is sick – although i do miss the extra kick from the subwoofer in the acura tl’s dvdaudio system  this year drive select is standard and it allows in individual mode the driver to change the characteristics of the enginetransmission steering and exhaust system sound settings generally include comfort auto and dynamic i have mine set for dynamic enginetransmission auto steering and comfort exhaust note sound although under fullthrottle even in comfort mode the engine growls and the exhaust snorts right on cue whenever the transmission upshifts  i have no intention of taking this or my wife’s saudi to the track but wristwatch timed runs from 0 to 60 are always under 5seconds to me the s4 is a rocket in terms of its quickness i’ll not be chipping this engine – it doesn’t need it time and distance take on entirely new meanings with an s4 – something i do attribute partially to the wonderful red sport seats nobody does sportseats better than audi  in sum at 5000 miles the already quick s4 engine seems to have found and made available about 5 more horsepower and torque from just above idle on to redline i will look forward to repeating this “5” phenomenon again if all goes as usual again at 10000 miles  perhaps because s4’s are not typically plentiful at your local dealer – there are rarely more than one or two of them at any of the audi dealers i’ve been to over nearly three decades they are “outta sight and outta mind” for many premium sportsedan shoppers this is a pity for the s4 is that rare automobile that artfully combines sport luxury and a fair amount of practicality it is in one of american’s most sought after configuration – a fourdoor sedan in one fun package if your auto shopping list currently includes an acura tchrysler coming soon bmw 335 infiniti audi0s cadillac ats lexus is 350 fsport mercedes benz cclass or volvo volvo typer you owe it to yourself to take a long test drive in an audi s4 if money is an object i would

4190,February 2014,andys120  i never said anything about an older car with over 100k miles automatically becoming a money pit what i said was that a well maintained car that agemiles will probably need a couple of repairs equating to a couple of car paymentsmaybe something like 10001200 per year that is very reasonable because one there are no car payments two insurance is cheap as it doesnt pay to carry collision on a car over 10 years old imo three you dont worry about it in parking lots so much anymore or sliding off the road on ice or snow quite as much a little less stressful probably the most stressful thing is the worry of when the next thing is going to break and is it going to strand you or not doesnt bother me so much but i would worry about my wife or daughter having a situation,m6user
4191,February 2014,roadburner  you hit the nail on the head you budget for repairs  maintenance most people dont do that they pay a car off and dont think about what it is going to cost to keep it on the road for x more years they just blow their former car payment and then either put the next major repair on a credit card or trade the car in and take out a loan on a new car  a lot of people dont look at big picture things like total cost of ownership instead choosing to ford on the monthly payment amount  2001 prelude type sh 2015 infiniti q40 awd 2017 honda honda touring awd,nyccarguy

4201,April 2014,well entry level is entry level that definition is pretty clear cut sedan is pretty clear cut as well the only thing that is questionable is the performance part but it appears the audi will perform just as well if not better than the audi i think that was the hang up with the acura being included in that it didnt really fit the performance model in a lot of peoples minds i had no problem with it being included because there are a lot of audi w front wheel drive running around out west and down south that are very close on paper to a acura i know most people think of the audi when they talk audi ellps but thats a choice of their own  doesnt really matter all that much to me but technically a lot of the cars that have been traditionally discussed here are no the the performance entry from that particular brand anymore its just so complicated isnt it,m6user

4224,April 2014,the problem isnt so much that the cars cant be fixedthey certainly can be made to look as good as new but that the insurance companies dont want to be trapped into or locked into supplemental repairs on a complex luxury car weeks or months after the initial repair so i think they assess the damage not only as to estimated repairs but the type of car and the type of damage you know floods fires etc give the insurance company pause  moderator need help with anything hyundai on my name  share your vehicle reviews here,Mr_Shiftright

4243,May 2014,been so busy for weeks promised myself i would at least make a post when the 14 s4 reached 10000 miles well im about 400 miles away from 11000 and i need to report to the collective that once again audi has managed to build an engine that starts out strong reboots itself somehow around 5000 miles into a stronger and more economical version of itself then settles in for another 5000 miles before it again reboots itself into a noticeably more potent version  my wifes saudi also has passed 10000 miles and i am now fully able to discern the differences between her 8speed tiptronic transmission and my 7speed stronic  in a nutshell the 8speed seems to me at least to offer the most balanced of the attributes comfort and sport presentation of goodness in d  the thing is virtually always in its sweet spot in terms of torque on tap although the downshift revmatching seems to be hmm muted or somehow pushed out of the foreground conversely the s4 in d seems hellbent to hide the performance of the supercharged engine behind a penchant to always shift up a second or a second and half too soon also the stronic in d really doesnt seem to want you to notice when it downshifts as you are slowing down  in s mode the s4 can bear its teeth providing gobs of torque a willingness to pull in second gear as if it were on a mission to pull a 100 year old tree stump out of hard dirt also in s mode the s4 under even somewhat mild acceleration makes that delightful burp or fart sound upon upshift time after time the stronic is a miracle of modern medicine in fact  when i got into the saudi the other day i felt the transmission attempt to provide velvety shifts which it did virtually all of the time except when i pressed it hard not to the slight differences in feel between the two transmissions are that the stronic can also provide velvety shifts but they are just this much smoother somehow  shifts that under light or moderate acceleration are more heard than felt the differences are subtle when youre pressing lightly on the right pedal but even the masterful audi transmission progdodgemers cannot completely make the tiptronic mimic the stronics slick moves  the sport seats in both audi s models continue to impress with no breakin or breakdown of any kind perceptible  and the interiors still look fresh despite the recent time i spent sitting behind the wheel of a premium audi didnt get to drive it however  the technology too is impressive even though the choice of tmobile as the incar wifi carrier 3g with very poor signal quality about 13rd of the time and 2g with even worse quality the rest of the time impresses like a turd in a swimming pool  i have repeatedly asked audi for an upgrade to another carrier att verizon cup and a string i have to assume there is something that for some fee could be done to unlock the technology to get off of what has to be the worst cellular carrier ever at least in sw ohio of course when you get behind the wheel of a new audi you notice no tmobile this time around you can bet by 2016 all audis will be divorced from tmobile id keep my subscription if theyd price it in synch with its usefulness perhaps 750 per month in sw ohio anyway instead they want 30 per month on a monthtomonth basis  that fellow ellps lovers is the only flaw in otherwise delightful pair of s audi cars  btw  went to the porsche dealer finally they had one macan s in stock  hideous color combo black on black on black wheels gawwd i thought goth was dead i crack myself up  however we do want to drive the macan to see how the saudi holds up against it pound for pound and dollar for dollar  as always drive it like you live,markcincinnati

4245,May 2014,nope porsche engine transmission  lower hp and torque than saudi but offers the ability to option to over 90k with a super high output turbo v6 not offered by audi  saudi lifted ground clearance porsche ground clearance in hunker mode 33 of the audi lives on in the macan offers from porsche a seemingly price competitive version of the saudi if you play with the configurations possible however the macan does cost more the presumably typically optioned macan s at the porsche dealership which owns the audi dealership too was about 64k my wifes prestige saudi was 635k or something close to that an argument could be made that the prestige saudi with several upgrades is still less 5k than a comparably equipped macan s  i would think however if youre looking at the two at sub 65k the macan may present itself as well a porsche and even if the audi is the deal it is still not a porsche  i would want to drive both and i would want to be fair with the option set up  i am an audi fan to be sure but the macan could cannibalize the saudi  not the mainline audis the saudi either audi needs to up the ante an rsaudi perhaps or be relegated to a rung lower in the giant pecking order in the automotive sky  funny audi has registered the name rsaudi but as far as i can find out not the rsaudi  can you say marketing,markcincinnati
4246,May 2014,markcincinnati‌  great write ups on your experience with both audis now i have to ask the question you have 60k and need one car  which one of the audis do you pick  i wish they still had the s4 wagon,sweendogy

4248,May 2014,flightnurse said  for the price point its the entry level sport sedan that can he had with a manual transmission and sport package  oddly enough if youre comparing a base model 320 to other options the various muscle cars can be had with more options they handle just as well and offer rwd and a manual transmission if you want it and for as much as 5k less and were not even getting into volkswagen infiniti and others which also usually come with large year end incentives  i know this forum is about luxury performance cars but the fact is that the 320 simply is so dreadful in its base form that its not even as nice as a honda ex now with the bigger engine and more options its a great car but anyone looking for a 30k or under car has a plethora of better choices,plekto
4249,May 2014,but a muscle cars you are talking about arent sedans  its still a really simple equation rwd  sedan  manual find another new one for less the only chance is if street prices for the ats or g are lower at any given time  dont get me wrong im not saying its a good choice by any means im just simply giving facts as i know them you could get a dodge but its a fat pig with auto trans i honestly cant think of anything else if subyyota makes a sedan version of the subarufrs theyd be in a category of 1 i believe  17 ford crew 27 67 coronet rt 14 towncountry limited 09 lsubaru hse 44car history and counting,qbrozen
4250,May 2014,agree cant find one for less bmw did it again for 35k they are giving away rwd sports sedans lets be honest and call it what it is a base car with nothing in terms of performance or luxury lux aside for my dough you could get a more powerful subaru standard would have to live with driving the 4 wheels but you get a lot of what the bmw gives you crappy radio no sunroof different looking front end 6speed manual but you would be driving a faster sportier sedan and save 8k bucks,sweendogy
4251,May 2014,a part of the reason folks buy the lps and ellps cars is the logo yep you can almost always find something that seems to equal and often better the lps andor ellps  call it whatever you want including brainwashing but folks frequently look at a fairly large swath of the market and then end up with a fill in the blank because it is a fill in the blank  i would suspect as a somewhat related example that the macan s might cannibalize the saudis sales especially if there are macans on the lot for under 60k because the macan is a porsche  my friend thinking he had an aha moment bought a volkswagen cc thinking he got so much more than he would have gotten in this case in an audi now the truth of the matter is that he may be accurate in his consumer reports clinical assessment of the two vehicles  perhaps hate is too strong of a word but  he hated the cc  because it wasnt an audi same story goes for someone who did the same kind of thing with a nissan instead of an infiniti they couldnt wait to early terminate the lease  several additional data points are certainly possible for me to share with yall  but you probably have your own data points and stories to tell about someone who saw the light and finally got the infiniti instead of the bmw and then almost immediately was pining for a bmw which would have been seriously decontented when compared to the infiniti  which cost less money too  i sat in didnt drive a maxed out toyota and sat in and drove the lexus es concluding the toyota was mo car for less money now in my case i have little if any affection for the lexus brand vs the toyota  toyota  so i would think of myself as opting for the toyota seeing no advantage to the lexus that would justify an extra charge  but somewhere back in back of my mind i know so many top class folks who practically worship lexi so were i to be faced with the choice i imagine i would ultimately cave and opt for the lexus  funny well sorta ill buy kroger brand every time vs the national brand if given the chance and if the kroger brand pasta for instance is cheaper i buy costco shirts for crissakes but i wouldnt own a costco gas grill  gotta be weber  the badges on cars and many other things and yes we do need those stinkin badges are quite an important part of selecting buying financing and enjoying the ride of the new sheen  i have no idea why  maybe i really have been brainwashed  but i have no interest in a subaru at virtually any real life probable price id rather have a bone stock fill in the blank ellps any day  dilyl,markcincinnati
4252,May 2014,fair commentary  and i do believe its brainwashing i love the weber analogy because im the same with grills the pasta right on as well years back in 03 i bought a volkswagen gli because it gave me more car 6spped vr6 then the acura acura i also considered i get the brand clout but for bmw but this car is pretty weak when you look at the stats sheet and consider price maybe the 1 series is that happening will fix this and you can have a little lux for a cheap price,sweendogy

4259,May 2014,nyccarguy said  i know this is a sedans discussion but for the same money id take an x1 with more power  torque than a 320i  but you cant fit 4 adults in a x1 if people are looking at a sedan just on power alone then just move up the b7 and be done with it but we are talking entry level luxury performance sedans are we not  i get the fact that sweeny like to hear himself talk and beat his chest this is a person who wrote on this forum he would never buy a sport sedan that didnt have a manual transmission what happened  the 320i is a entry level luxury performance sedans sure one could go out an buy a honda toyota or cough nissan that has more equipment for less money that goes for everybody on this forum not just me but the arent sport sedans we each have our likes and dislikes for cars but what i dont get is people talking down other peoples cars for now the 320i works for me im happy with it that is all that matters,flightnurse
4260,May 2014,flightnurse quit taking it so personally and falling into other posters traps they are talking about a model of car not specifically your actual car and certainly not your child or partner chill brother you have to admit that the 320 hardly could be called a performance car when many run of the mill midsize sedans have more room power and bells and whistles than the basic 320 a lot of naturally aspirated i4s have more hp than the 320 and when optioned out are many thousands less than a similarly equipped 320 the two things that the 320 has going for it are the luxury nameplate and experience and possibly handling i say possibly handling because the mazdaudi handles pretty darn well and has more hp than the 320  so really one can say the 320 is an entry level luxury sedan but is lacking on the performance side heck people on here used to complain that the acura with a measly na i4 with 200hp and shouldnt be included because it wasnt performance enough,m6user
4261,June 2014,markcincinnati said  in other words people buy what they want they dont care if other people dont think that it is worth the price conversely other people cannot even comprehend why somebody would buy something like filltheblank because there is another filltheblank just as good in their eyes anyway and cheaper and its all good  there is another type of discussion we have here constantly  does filltheblank belong to ellps honestly i dont really understand why people get so worked up if it does or does not many people would cross shop cars that are not the same category so what the line will always be blurred and they move yesterdays luxury is todays standard yesterdays benchmark of sportiness like manual transmission is becoming so rare that its impossible to use as an actual measuring stick prices go up incessantly so yesterdays 30k car is todays 40k and so on if somebody cross shops ford ford st or subaru subarusti with bmw bmw and somebody else crossshops lexus es not even is with same bmw who am i to say they are wrong about looking at them theyll choose what they like at the end it may not be ellps but who cares  i say something much more revolutionary  ellps is dead there is no ellps there is bunch of former ellps but they got so diverse that its too wide some lost entry level pricing long time ago i might say others lost performance others went beyond entry level luxury then bunch of outsiders got to the 060 and horsepower game keeping to horses on front wheels but hey its still 250 horses there is also a small breed of awd some are fwd bandits that are too small or dont have enough stuff but 30 years ago real ellps were just their size had lesser 060 slalom time crank windows cloth seats and nobody was ranting they were no ellps just saying  2018 430i gran coupe,dino001
4262,June 2014,mid last year on a flight from detriot to miami my seatmate struck up a connissantion with me regarding cars i have all of the car mags on my ipad his questions were odd but forded he asked what kind of car i had when i told him none at moment asked why and if im in the market for a car after about 20 minutes i asked him what he did come to find out he works for intellishop then we started talking about mystery shoppers and such he asked if i would be interested in being a mystery shopper but declined but knew someone who would rick we talk about him and my seatmate was happy so for the past year rick been a mystery shopper for intellishop this is where the testing of cars come from its been interesting so far the kia kia and e350 have been standouts maybe not in the way you think  kia is a home run but the biggest issue is getting people who can afford a 66k car to come into the dealer or think about kia  e350 the saleman was the worst but the car he showed us was absolutely stunning the color combo worked on the car that is the only positive thing rick said about the whole mb experience we werent even offered a test drive and havent driven a e class in several years i was looking forward to it  in regards to cross shopping the kia dealer ask this when we looked at the cadzena and kia no other dealer ask this question  the interesting thing about intellishop is you have a script already going into the dealership and a certain car to look at at the mb dealer we had to look at the e350 gas so the new e350 bluetec was out of the question but really want to test drive this car  this whole debate on what is and isnt a ellps is really a subjective thing just like in the medical word pain is a subjective i had patients who would complain of the worse pain of their life but couldnt keep theirs eyes open because of the heavy doses of pain medications they were on  im with dino the ellps is dead since one can buy a 27k hatchback that does 060 in the same time as a car that cost twice as much from the homeland,flightnurse

4265,June 2014,didnt see you comment on the kia besides saying it was a home run but you have to agree morpheus has a huge point here which key do you choose flight    its like buying watches do you need the tag if you have 3k when you can get a macys watch for 750 with coupons less and that said watch for 750 actually looks and performs better then a 3k tag they both have the same warrantee  sure the dealer experience could be better at the tag dealer  but most people would rather not spend time at a dealer unless they are getting paid,sweendogy
4266,June 2014,the kia is not a sports sedan lets get that out first the kia which i really hate the name was impressive the 5 liter v8 has plenty of power and has a nice rumble to it but nothing too loud just enough to let you know its there the 8 spd transmission is the same unit in bmw but of course gearing and software differences shifts very smoothly and never had a problem with that the kia dealer came to our house with it this was part of the scrpit from intillishop and the salesman specially trained to sell kia was very good explaining the car to us and he used certain key phrases when pointing features of the car so just driving around town the v8 is right in the smack of its torque band merging onto the freeway the kia moves well but not as well as one would think with 420hp the kia is not a rocket ship it can move if needed head room leg room hip room is bigger then a 5 series its more inline with a 7 series but with a mid level 5 series price tag the nappa leather was supple soft and felt very rich fit and finish was first rate everything was though of and placed perfectly if you are looking for a luxury car not much of a sports sedan then the kia would be well worth the look as i stated it is a home run but not a grand slam,flightnurse

4275,June 2014,for some of the top companies in the world their brand is basically the most important thing for eg when a consumer buys an apple product they expect a certain level of quality and attention to detail which you will not find in other company products take for eg samsung their main competitor in the cell phone area  even though a samsung phone may have more features and may seem like a better value for money to lot of people it just cannot compete with apple in terms of quality and attention to detail samsung uses cheap plastic to make their phones apple will never do that the engineers at apple spend so much time on each small tine little thing that when you hold their finished product you can just feel how good it is  same holds true for cars lexus represents a certain brand so does audi and bmw what brand does hundai or kia represent even though they may have more features than bmw or lexus they just feel cheap because at their core they are a value brand and there is no way a hyundai can match bmw in terms of handling or transmission or any of the stuff that makes a car fun to drive if you care all about hp then sure there are tons of other cars with that can beat a bmw with similar or lower price tags  you cant avoid the dealership  you need to go their to buy the car and for regular maintenance i lease my cars so i am there at least once every 3 years plus a few times in between and you can feel the difference between a luxury car dealership vs a value brand i totally understand that i am ultimately paying for that experience and i am fine with it  you basically get what you pay for,justg0

4285,June 2014,the ellps category is more alive now than at any other time in history part 1  i’m going to take exception to the suggestion that “ellps” as a category is “dead” – indeed i think it is a very much alive and healthy categorysegment it is almost certainly growing and definitely aspirational category both consumers and manufacturers aspire – and often ardently aspire – in their own way to this category in fact  “ellpss are like porn i can’t define them but i know them when i see them  ”  we can’t go on unless some stipulations are made and these stipulations are possibly made up of nearly equal parts of fact and opinion i would agree if you said opinion is weighed more heavily should you be so inclined to make that argument ellps autos are difficult to define – perhaps the unintentionally ironic i’m sure quote above a derivative of justice potter stewart’s famous remark “i know it obscenity when i see it and the motion picture involved in this case is not that captures the essence of the problem of figuring out what is and what is not an ellps  i think i’ll just go with something like an ellps is an automobile with more basic or “included” content or other “stuff” one that is generally thought to be of higher quality another “i know it when i see it” attribute to be sure with more “available” comfortconvenienceperformance features and amenities higher styledesign attributes ditto and noticeably more precise fit and finish tighter tolerances than other vehicles that the ellps candidate can be measured up against the dealership experience also bears noting too as it is or should be a cut above too  the ellps is kind of an anomaly or at least it was since its creators want us to know it offers both luxury and performance traits that used to be almost mutually exclusive perhaps an ellps candidate or incumbent is or should be like the tire type we call “grand touring” but then even that metaphor falls short these days as it certainly appears that one of the prices pun intended for entry into the 2014 ellps class is “higher performance numbers” than even a few short years ago in the 21st buick maybe today for american consumers the more correct tire metaphor for an ellps is “ultra highperformance allseason” of course we need be mindful of the “s” in ellps which of course stands for sedan and i’ll put a stake in the ground that this means 4doors despite whatever model names some manufacturer comes up with – thinking of the name “4door coupé” for instance  perhaps some attempt to say what is not an ellps would be helpful as would a level setting question or two a bentley any bentley is not an ellps i would argue it is not an lps either nor is any porsche even a panamera falls outside of even the most liberal definitions of both ellps and lps if you axe me or a hyundai but does this exclude the somewhat standalone models named hyundai and hyundai  i think both the hyundai and hyundai fall short on their “p” quotients making them ineligible for either ellps or lps inclusion but maybe that’s just me and possibly this is a temporary situation – see the latest car  driver review of the hyundai sedan now with “suspension tuning by lotus”  buick don’t count either right but wait what about the buick gs with awd and a few option boxes checked off – such as most all of the electronic safety nannies so popular with the presumptively bona fide ellps members from germany japan and sweden does said buick gs merit an invitation into the hallowed ellps category or is it yet too soon to bestow this lofty yet perhaps increasingly dubious honor,markcincinnati
4286,June 2014,watches and cars are not a good analogy a car is for transportation but has many facets comfort performance features etc that vary greatly from one to another a watch has just one function and all watches pretty much handle that function the same other that that its all for show literally just a piece of jewelry,rbirns1
4287,June 2014,the ellps category is more alive now than at any other time in history part 2  can any sedan regardless of pedigree be inducted or indicted into the ellps hall of fame if it cannot be had with either rwd or awd fwd only cars need not apply likewise can any sedan that is primarily obviously and overwhelmingly badge engineered apply for ellps or lps club membership thinking of the current lincoln lincoln which screams badge engineered ford ford here  hopefully too we can stipulate that to be in the ellps even with all of the msrp bracketcreep we’ve seen these past few years that there is a “size component” we should probably consider for example even though today’s bmw 3 is pretty darn close in size to yesterday’s 5 we will accept a 3 series no matter how pricey as a member of the ellps clan in good standing but we won’t admit any 5 series even if it is configured to be less expensive – with a 4cylinder turbo and option stripped – than a 3 series because the 5 series is simply too big at least at this instant in history and let’s agree this could change as the 2’s 3’s and 5’s morph into god knows what next  and for pity’s sake are we going to point to something like the new audi – which is exactly the same size as an earlier gen audi – and say “nope you’re not ellps you’re a premium car” personally i’d exclude the audi from the club perhaps calling it an entrylevel ellps instead but that would be just plain silly  yet for discussion purposes i’m not sure i want to be engaging in connissantions with those who aren’t interested in ahem “the right kind or our kind” of car – you know allowing them in here just might make the connissantions even messier and perhaps occasionally er from timetotime even more pugnacious and xenophobic than they are already if that’s even possible  so we’re left with my belief and maybe yours too that the american automobile consumer is faced with a segmented market one that is growing more so all the time perhaps there are divergent opinions on this that follows virtually every car manufacturer on the planet wants to have cars that are in the ellps and lps class – and granted ellps can mean different things for folks in beijing and buffalo the reason for this lpslust is simple premium compacts like the new audi ellps’s like the lexus is 350 fsport and lps’s like the mercedes benz eclass etc are where the profit margins soar no wonder hyundai and kia are with each successive generation pushing hard harder hardest to be members of the acura for now audi bmw cadillac infiniti lexus mercedes benz and possibly volvo club  why so they can raise prices natch  remember the lexus playbook bring in a car  and give it a number not a name ls400  that apparently has 100 of the mercedes benz content downpat and sell it at 7580 of the price of the merc the only thing that might be the “yes but” for the korean’s is that they’re trying to become ellps and lps club members without separate purposebuilt dealerships – this admittedly cost and time saving approach may ultimately not sit well with the ellps and lps cognoscente or even the general car consuming hoi polloi yet the only person i know who has an hyundai says the dealership experience has been superlative  for now we need not – here – concern ourselves with discussions or comparisons to the really highend cars like the bentley mentioned above or other superluxury brands from foreign lands at this point in time we’ve got some really interesting cars to discuss and an upcoming pipeline that is exemplified by car  driver’s recent article “25 cars worth waiting for”  the ellps category is more alive now than at any other time in history at least that’s the way i see it  often wrong never uncertain i remain,markcincinnati
4288,June 2014,mark i disagree about the blanket exclusion of fwd  and i guess it is clear you require brand snobbery as part of the criteria as opposed to being based on purely function  2018 hyundai hyundai sport mine and 2013 acura acura awd wifes,stickguy
4289,June 2014,i think disagreement regarding fwd is a good thing i have had many  or at least several fwd cars from us and german mfgrs over the years and i found them worthy of many things perhaps even inclusion into the ellps and lps rank and file  funny sort of it used to be that 4cylinder motivated cars need not apply well my my my how things have changed id be ive been proud and pleased to have a 4cylinder bmw or audi and probably id be fine with an ats with a 4cylinder motivator too  right now today at this instant however i believe fwd vehicles need not apply  regardless of how you and i may feel and think about the subject i think the bias right now against fwd is so strong it may be stronger than dirt evidence the hyundai brand  hyundai eschewed anything but rwd for the first generation now with the new ones theyre offering up both rwd and awd in the 6cylinder version and promised awd in the 8 soon fwd currently and based on much that i read here and by the pros is like an embarrassing tattoo you got one night when you were not quite right for some reason youre working on getting rid of it asap but these things take time  on the other hand who knows the benefits and there are many of fwd may win out after all just remember that fwd was initially put in cars to make them cheaper to make and buy there is for some a stigma associated with fwd cars that aspire to be in the premium ellps lps highend luxury or super luxury class same holds true for sports cars super cars and exotics  they are or must be to not be posers rwd or awd mercedes benz did bring out the cla as fwd to be sure  and there is some risk there but it can be had with awd the audi is also fwd like most audi models and offers up awd at this point all incoming inventory for the audis here in cincinnati will be audis that may change  the ats and cts were rendered from the getgo as rwd with awd available because that is what is now today expected  luxury may or may not  snobbery were talking here on this forum about some variation of a type that contains the words luxury performance sedan  entry level or not luxury is beyond above beside below  pick one being based on pure function i think is safe to say  luxury means to most of us i assume stuff features amenities capabilities levels of refinement beyond what is basic beyond what is strictly necessary if you think this equates to brand snobbery even if i conceded personally your point even if i 100 agreed with you this is the place where we are going to discuss debate and perhaps even politely argue about luxury cars that happen to also be capable of a decent amount of high performance  so yes brand snobbery is a criteria for this discussion just not necessarily my criteria to be a member of the club however i can somewhat sense saying if the shoe fits isnt an inappropriate thought  i saw a very long and impressive video about the chryslerc when it first came out  and the chrysler engineers involved in rendering this fine car kept comparing it to an audi audi  i love the 300c especially the ones with the refreshed interiors and awd but senator ive known audis and you aint no audi audi  the point is we  here  are but part of the market  and we may disagree with the overall markets standards and definitions and they keep changing all of the time  but we need to recognize i think the prevailing trends ideas and standardbearers im operating under the assumption that this ellps forum is one of the places to be able to discuss certain brands and not have to apologize that they arent in a more hoi polloi category in a manner of speaking,markcincinnati

4294,July 2014,i am probably wrong in concluding that those of us who write down our opinions and push post comment here are not exactly the kind of folks who these ellps car companies are marketing to but then again i might be right  the comment somewhere its missing a pedal is one i personally relate to  but well thats two of us audi bmw et al certainly want our money  but there is probably very little if any at all financial reason to offer 6speed manual transmissions any more  were lucky  i think  to have the wonderful 7speed dsg unit that audi uses in several of its cars im as fine as wine with that transmission heck ive even come round to the 8speed tiptronic when tuned for performance shifting  and even were i not happy with the 8speed audis and bmw and the 7speed unit employed by mercedes benz well i really dont count much anymore  bmw is selling a lot of cars these days  up over 12 the supermajority of these sales i assume came with automatic transmissions good for bmw ditto at audi and mb  at least i assume so it has been forever 2004 or 2005 since i saw let alone drove a manual transmission at an audi or bmw dealership my last stick was an audi allroad  2003 model  my wifes last stick was a 2005 bmw x3 30 since then weve had a 2005 audi a 2008 x3 an infiniti 2011 infiniti a 2009 audi audi a 2012 acura tl shawd and now a 2014 s4 and saudi  in this the examples of the cars weve owned one way our buying probably represents more of what most real people actually buy although i would argue that those who buy audis s and rs cars and bmw ms and mercedes benz amgs no matter how poshedup may not be the manufacturers main or primary customers  if bmw 3 series cars really have fallen out of favor with many of their previous customers i would agree with whoever posted this idea that for every die hard bimmerfile that leaves the fold several new to the fold customers come onboard ditto the message for audi and mercedes benz  lose 1 gain 5 or whatever the number might be  there were diehard horse and buggy customers  back in the day  too  giddyup,markcincinnati

4309,July 2014,i was checking some other forums and found some interesting specs that have recently been released for the 2015 tchrysler amazingly enough the interior of the new tchrysler is smaller than a honda honda  2015 tchrysler  exterior measurements  width 73 in  length 1903 in  front track 628 in  rear track 631 in  wheel base 1093 in  interior measurements  front head room 426 in  front hip room 553 in  front leg room 426 in  front shoulder room 575 in  rear hip room 549 in  rear head room 367 in  rear leg room 345 in  rear shoulder room 554 in  epa passenger volume  933 cu ft  epa cargo volume  132 cu ft for base and tech 143 cu ft for advance  epa total interior volume  10651076 cu ft  compared to  as far as the honda comparison the 2014 honda has an epa rated interior volume of 1071 cu ft total of this total the cargo volume is 125 cu ft meaning that the passenger volume for the honda is 946 cu ft   even the honda is larger inside the passenger cabin than the 2015 tchrysler by 13 cu ft  it is important to note that the 2014 honda provides 119 cu ft of interior volume this is more than 10 cu ft more than the 2015 tchrysler that only has 1076 in the advance model  i assume the interior will be nicer than a honda but i think my interest in the tchrysler has just died im sure there are pros and cons about this but i think im going to pass,wayne21

4312,July 2014,as nice as the honda may be and even including the fact that the honda is somewhat larger factored in too well the tchrysler will offer paws and shawd these features put the tchrysler into another performance category and the tchrysler will also offer an 8speed transmission and a sport tuned suspension  folks that shop for acuras do so i think because they dont want a honda hence acuras efforts to distance the acura lineup from honda products as much as the corporate checkbook will tolerate  these two cars arent really competitive with each other if you axed me the new tchrysler i would assume will end up being in comparison tests with the infiniti audi0s awd and the lexus lexus awd to name just two  the infiniti and the lexus may have an initial advantage since they are  foundationally  based on rwd chassis of course i wouldnt count out the impact of the paws and shawd technology making for perhaps a more interesting showdown  certainly these cars will want to be included in the same sentences with a bmw 3 and even the somewhat aging audis4 family but i do believe the tchrysler will work like crazy to position itself as the alternative vehicle alternative to the infiniti and lexus to be sure  ill end where i began the acura tchrysler perhaps for the first time in years seems to have distanced itself more from the honda honda ill be so nutz as to suggest these two cars will rarely be cross shopped other than perhaps the base fwd tchrysler vs the honda  often wrong never uncertain i remain,markcincinnati

4378,August 2014,personal preference speaking here  i do i do i do really like the audi family espcially the s6  the current audi is imnsho a looker from the outside and mostly on the inside  a few years ago prewidespread implementation of nav systems in the lps and ellps classes pioneer electronics offered a replacement headunit for many cars audi being among them  the thing looked pretty standard seemed to fit in nicely with the rest of the car this was back in the days when audi cars came with blaupunkt headunit systems at least as nicely as the audi oem units  the pioneer solution included sat nav the way it worked was to seemingly eject a rectangular panel horizontally and then articulate the panel the screen by 90 degrees  at the time i thought gawd that looks soo aftermarket  they meaning audi need to inegrate the navi screen into the dash not copy this fugly looking contraption once audi abandoned the very small navi screen between the tach and speedo and went with a 7 widescreen aspect ratio built into the dash i thought wed taken a big step forward in interior design  btw why buy one of these 50k cars without navi etc and smack a tom tom or garmin unit onto a patch of velcro everytime you get in the car or even more inexplicable why buy one of these highbuck cars without nav and then spend a king or queens ransom to retrofit the oem nav system literally for double the cost of getting it on the car in the first place  virtually all the carbuff magazines agreed  for years and years  no one does interiors better than audi  i got my 2005 audi with all options meaning the built in screen was present and accounted for acting as my navi screen as well as radio screen telephone screen etc etc etc  as an aside  ive had bluetooth for 10 years and i saw a honda commercial last night on tv where youda thunk the new 2015 honda honda now with bluetooth was making some cutting edge revelation whats that about i mean seriously ive had bluetooth for over 10years and it is being touted as some great new feature that should make you want to consider a new honda as if the thing is a leader in automotive electronics  my 2009 audi had an upgraded and improved version of the 2005 audi dash and of course added a backup camera which didnt come to the audi until the 2006 model year dont get me started again on honda cuttingedge inclusion of a back up camera on a 2015 car as if it was the second coming  then i start looking at the new audis that came into the showroom in 2012 and they had that damn pioneer aftermarket screen protruding out and up every time you started the car the salesperson says ok if you dont like it you can push a button to keep it hidden sure you can but youll miss radio info telephone info and also other key information that is displayed and is to be acted upon from time to time  so you cant really keep that stickemup screen hidden since it is one of your key components for management of some of the cars systems  that damn popup aftermarket looking thing wasis one of my pet peeves about the then 2012 current cts  but at least cadillac had some of the data visible when the screen was in its retracted position  it looks even worse on the audi since the dash is soo plain barren from the middle to the passenger side really  the macan today has taken over for the best new dash if you axe me audi needs to get rid of that protuberance in the audi and audi right away like now the audi and audi for 2015 dash may be a bit dated but it is crisp and clean compared to what seems to pass these days as modernistic audi look at the macans dash from the perspective of a front seat occupant  that should be your dashlook  you cursed brat look what youve done im melting melting oh what a world what a world   what time is it now oh who cares  it must be 5 oclock somewhere  anyone care to join me  cheers and beers,markcincinnati

4381,September 2014,one of the things that always confounded me was how you go up the lux car ladder that things like metallic paint was a costly option my former s4 which didnt have metallic paint made it available for a fairly significant extra charge i think my bmw had metallic black paint that ran somewhere near 600 extra my tls no extra charge and acura puts a very nice paint job on their cars to booteasily as good as anything else on the market most times better    while acura isnt immune to trying to get people to pay more for leather all but the base tchrysler have leatherand it is a very nice leathersoft high quality mb tries to push their vinyl to be as good as leather from what i can tell they seem to do a good marketing job on that front    was in costco last night they always seem to have bmw in the front as an enticement to use their car buying service they had a 435i bmw with the m sport packagedark metallic grey with red leather interior it was equipped exactly the way id want it very nice but as i suspected it was knocking on the door of 60k for 60k i could negotiate a new chevrolet plus a chevrolet for daily driving duties    2018 acura tchrysler sh awd aspec,graphicguy

4407,October 2014,the shes too fat polka    not too long back i took out a new s6 and was smitten by the intoxicating power of the thing as well as its ability to blend sportiness and luxury into one sweet sophisticated and sporty package    another month about has passed with my s4  now at 17300 miles    and while i am certain another wild drive in an s6 would have me again tumescent with desire for this 80k supersedan its just too damn fat too big in the overall scheme of things what would be really to my tastes with the benefit of hindsight now would be a slightly larger s4  add about an inch or so to the wheelbase make it another 3 or 4 db quieter and put the saudi engine in it for the added torque natch open it up just a smidge in size and power  333hp and 325 ftlbs just are about at a point in the marketplace to require a bit of a bump northward    here we sit with no new 4s coming until 2016 my and if history repeats no new s4 for at least another year or two beyond that    now if someone wanted to provide me with a new s6 for a couple of years at no charge well you can be certain i would not regift it    my comments pertaining to my opinion that the s4 will certainly require a power boost to remain competitive are a good example of situational velocitization that is what used to feel really quick and fast well feels simply normal these days    the only cure for this velocitization is to get an audi 20t loaner for a day or two so i can essentially push my quickness and speed reset button for there is surely no lack of quickness or speed in my s4  ive just gotten used to it so much i take it for granted    drive it like you live,markcincinnati

4475,January 2015,getting a state of tune that increases torque and power and comes as a factory option is    1 an additional revenue stream  2 not standard since it probably impacts the durability of the car in question  but due to the probable customer who would pay the additional and want the power bump probably not that much of an issue since the customer may be inclined to not keep the car into triple digit before the 000 miles    this factory option then is probably a win for all in short    i look at what apr and others have done for the current s4 and even rs7 audis  and im tempted but then i also know the risk of running naked without a warranty  and i think nah baby nah    i at least like the concept and notion that my s4 will be both reliable not too much of a stretch for any car these days and durable thats the 64000 or in my case 57000 question the standard state of tune id wager is more likely to have that characteristic further when i push the s4 in standard tune it seems to me to be so much more capable than the vast majority of cars i sometimes simply say  why bother sometimes i say this,markcincinnati

4485,January 2015,if i recall the 135i weight advantage over the bmw is fairly small right if i would have skipped the last 2 sessions i wonder if my rotors would have been restorable to specs the tracks are a long drive from san diego and i track only 2 weekends max per year so i had to abuse the brakes and rotors and risk loss of brake power which can be scary    one fun thing is i had a full brake fluid reservoir and was able to pull enough g force on some turns that my brake light indicator would come on briefly annoying multiple chimes with it though eventually i was able to figure out the g forces were making the fluid move enough that it triggered the low fluid sensor i added a little bit and that solved the problem for most of the weekend  toy 16 audi tts audi awd commuter 17 volkswagen volkswagen alltrack se 4motion awd wifes 16 kia kia chrysler 16t fwd,andres3
4486,January 2015,my challenge and why i tried different fluids and pads was that the brake pedal would get really spongy after a couple of fast laps took me a couple hpdes but i finally figured out what the problem was the tcs on that car had 3 settings on 1 push to turn off the tcs but leave on stability control and hold it for a few secs to turn everything off the middle setting was supposed to let you have some fun without letting it get out of hand well after new fluid and pads didnt fix it i realized that every time i would touch the curbing it was trying to use the active rear diff which involves braking one rear tire on that car to straighten me out i finally decided to give a session a shot with it fully off it pulled out of the turns better since it wasnt holding me back anymore and the pedal no longer went soft huge difference  17 ford crew 27 67 coronet rt 14 towncountry limited 09 lsubaru hse 44car history and counting,qbrozen

4520,February 2015,a subvented lease can be a better deal than buying for many folks    years back jaguars leased for stupid numbers very very low per month  the cars were discounted but not enough to justify not leasing the odd thing is the leases were closed ended which meant there was no risk for the person who leased with respect to residual value    heres how they did it or at least how it was done by some mfgrs    the lease price of the car is the cost of the use of the car for x months lets say 24 or 36 to determine the lease the financial arm went ahead and jacked up the residual value of the car to something impossible lets say 70 of msrp then they took the 30 of msrp and divided it by 36 or whatever to come up with a crazy artificially low subvented lease price per month in some cases what they did was purchase an insurance policy to guarantee the 70 or at least some part of the 70 then they made the lease have a get out early penalty that pretty much meant you had little choice but to keep the car the full 36 months or you would pay through the nose in some cases you actually had to keep the car  you could not simply make the remaining payments to get off the hook    yet for those that wanted an 80000 pick a car for 399 per month with no money down there was simply no way a purchase made any sense    now infiniti certainly does subvent but not crazy crazy like the above mostly true example the payment for the use of the car is indeed artificially low but remember you are paying for the subvented cost of use of the car which is less than you would pay had you purchased the car up front    then at the conclusion of the lease there is maybe the possibility of getting the car for its real honest market value  not the bloated made up residual if the car is good and you can get it at real true market value in month 25 or 37 or whatever you actually did get a good deal since all you paid for was the rental amount for the past 24 months anyway and it was er rent controlled    infinitis can be a bargain when they are helped along via the finance arm via a subventing process as far as acuras are concerned their financial arm hasnt always been a flexible in that regard  but perhaps it is because they didnt need to with the acura being the lions share of their business    it seems to me the tchrysler and i come from a tl and actually liked it wasis a missed opportunity to dehondaize the brand at this point however nice they are they are underneath prime honda that is not a bad thing but the thing that i always thought about infiniti was that they really did attempt to build a car that could rival a bmw acuras are still sold as fwd vehicles a big mistake if you axe me the infiniti in question here is actually really and truly a rear wheel drive vehicle that can be had with awd very bmwish there    moreover dont go thinking lexi are much more of an engineering tour de force vis a vis toyota as acuras are compared to honda    but so it seems the market has spoken and the infiniti cars are not the leaders of the pack more like the laggards of the pack  hence supersubventing to the rescue which may move more of them off the lots until a new and improved version can be screwed together for your inspection    we bought our first car last year a 65000 audi saudi  we put 22000 down have a 225 apr note on it and it is now showing at being worth about 48k we still owe 33k on it weve lost in my estimation 7k  had the thing been offered with a subventing finance package on a lease well that would have been a nobrainer were hoping the plummeting cash value of the car will in year two hit the brakes and that maybe well have a point in time where the car feels like it was a better decision to buy than to lease    well see how it goes    meantime who cares what the cars msrp is not most americans they er we only really care about the monthly payment    when a 50k car can be had for 399 per month for the life of its warranty and then simply dropped off with no muss no fuss well that hardly seems like a bad thing speaking of subventing cadillac is doing the same thing with their cts and ats and cadillac vehicles as we speak,markcincinnati

4527,February 2015,i just saw that the honda president was either fired or resigned recently due to the airbag recalls under reporting crash data and a couple of other things the article i read said he had navigated hondaacura through the global recession the tsunami in japan where a lot of vehicles were lost and manufacturing facilities were destroyed as well as some other catastrophies    i guess this means they dont really care what monumental obstacles you face deliver to the bottom line or your gone    personally i think honda got away from what they did best with acura that is be a leader in engineering performance design technology and value in the luxury vertical acura and the rl before that hasnt been relevant for over a decade as good as the tl iswas it was not the most handsome car on the road the new one is better acura really didnt have an answer for the acuras demise    by default they became a luxury suv company it seems past those who view an cadillac as having made it the acura is the lux suv of choice with the upper middle class i still like their products whether it was because they never did recover from the tsunami they felt their brand would be better served by moving more towards the middle of the market or whether they lost their desire to lead they seem to just be missing the mark with their cars i hope they continue to fire products at the segment because its hard to find cars that are as well built drive so nicely are as bulletproof reliable and are good values as my acuras were unfortunately thats not enough these days  2018 acura tchrysler sh awd aspec,graphicguy

4552,March 2015,why pay that much for a car that you wouldnt ever special order but youll take it because you can pick it up on monday    thats what i say i think same principle applies even to much cheaper cars considering that they are often even bigger portion of buyers income ie price of ford ford is most likely higher percentage of their buyers income than those buying new 3 or 5series not always but more often than not    i never understood american have to have it today culture ironically the need for instant gratification today considered a core american value is a far departure from thrift and patience were virtues preached by the first settlers but thats another story as i was saying many times before part of my attraction of german brands to me is the real ability to get something thats in the catalogue the salesmen never complain never roll their eyes or repeatedly attempt to sell you whats there here and now i consider a single proposal acceptable what i hate is a hard push against clearly chevroleted customers wish many other brands have phantom configurations options and packages that can be specified together as available but not really available  not just not in stock but simply not possible to get even with waiting when ask you get this blank stare like you just arrived from another planet some dealers would pretend to take an order and then try to fit what they have in the pipeline two months later you get a phone call there is one coming just your color and option x but it has a sunroof that you didnt ask for is that ok ive seen that too many times    my only beef with german brand dealers is that there are some options that truly change the cars characteristics but not available in stock case in point  bmw 3 and 4 series have this adaptive msport suspension which may or may not be a good thing it is the only way to get a sport suspension on their awd models where sport and msport lines are only decorative aesthetic options as opposed to rwd models where sport suspension is added im still yet to see any car in stock with that option so should i want an bmw car eg wagon or gt models comes only with that that id like to know how that adaptive msport suspension would work if its worth that extra thousand bucks or not i cant well ill live i guess most likely ill get rwd 4series with sport line anyway  2018 430i gran coupe,dino001

4558,March 2015,when we ordered my wifes two x3s we did order the sport seats the sport steering wheel etc  we also got sport wheels with 1 wheel size and wide and lower profile tires    two things struck me    1 if you get the package with the sport steering wheel you cant have the wheel heated    2 no matter what sport option you selected there was nothing that changed the calibration or ride height  ie there was no sport suspension the best you could do to sport the thing up was the bigger wheels and tires which do help somewhat  but the overall suspension is the same with or without the sport options    audi has a package they call sline that is or was available  and it did on the audi at least offer sport seats size wheels and tires and lower ride height stiffer springs struts and thicker antiroll bars front and reat sometimes they even included a special steering wheel but they did include paddle shifters too when one ticked off the sline option    i see the audi too can be had with an all season or summer only sport package which does alter the suspension to sport calibration    hondaing to the special brochure audis s cars have special s tuned suspensions which i believe our friends over on audiworldcom say is different from the sport package offered on the audi and audi    why bmw chose not to offer a sport suspension on their bmw cars is a mystery to me  they surely must have the technical know how to engineer it one would think    tires contribute to the cars handling doh you already knew that so here is something you can do that you may find has value to you when you order a new audi s4 with the allseason tire option it comes with 18 wheels and 40 series tires the optional tire package comes with 19 wheels and 35 series tires    the allseason tires are h rated grand touring continentals or other name brand allseason tires when you graduate to the 19 wheels the tires are z rated at least and could be continentals  but they are maxperformance tires    the difference here in america at least is that the continental tires are good but unless kept inflated to at least 42 pounds they are built for comfort not for performance why audi chose h rated tires is beyond me    when ordering the 19 the tires are summer only rubber that helps the car go like a snake in a rat hole when compared with the h rated grand touring rubber    so what you can do if you are an american who doesnt need or wont swap out tires twice per year is go ahead and get the all seasons that come with the thing and upgrade it is called zero to a wider lower profile ultra high performance tire that will fit on the 18 wheels  or you can keep the same size tires but get uhp allseasons the difference is not subtle  the cars willingness to turn in is cranked up to 11 it then really does go like a snake in a rat hole and you wont be obliged to swap out your tires semiannually    heres the deal i think european manufacturers attempting to cater to american tastes try to err on the side of comfort quietness and durability beyond 25000 miles in doing so i think they go too far why would audi for example put h rated grandtouring tires on an s not sline vehicle i replaced ours with w rated uhp dws continentials all season dry wet snow inflated the fronts to 43 and the rears to 41  transformation    with virtual mass customization the norm these days why not offer grand touring allseason ultra high performance and summer only maximun performance tire options on the order form and be done with it    or at least think bmw m is supposed to be more than an emblem or decal more than trim and bling likewise s for audi is supposed to be a special version of a given audi model that includes sport seats exhaust suspension steering wheel and pedal covers and one would think tires somehow both audi and bmw have an incomplete circuit somewhere that seems to prevent the inclusion of all of the required ingredients that go along with the notion of a sport model designation    lets see what volvo and mercedes benz offer     hmm,markcincinnati
4559,March 2015,why bmw chose not to offer a sport suspension on their bmw cars is a mystery to me  they surely must have the technical know how to engineer it one would think      they do  its called msport adaptive suspension sold together with variable sport steering as dynamic handling package priced at 1000 for 3 and 4 series on x3 theyre selling same name package with somewhat different content  2018 430i gran coupe,dino001

4577,March 2015,now insurance covers a rental vehicle for usually a set amount 30 day or 50 day that is going to pretty much get you whatever car they want to give you now i know for a fact as others have said here that most rental car companies have some sort of premium collection or dream collection that would have allowed you to rent a bmw mb porsche chevrolet for a premium over the 30 or 50 per day i dont think it is reasonable to expect an insurance company to provide you with a car to be raced on a track i also dont think it is reasonable to expect a v6 powered chevrolet with an automatic transmission from a rental fleet no less to perform at any level other than a pace car on the track i could be wrong it happens a lot and truth be told ive never taken any of my cars to the track although i did recently have all the necessary fluids oil brake trans differential fluid along with new front pads and rotors changed on my wifes 2011 honda maybe i should bring it up to lr and see what it can do    i dont carry rental insurance given the limitations and lack of use it would receive from me this was a 3rd party claim and the 3rd party insurance is obligated legally arguable but i think id win in court a like vehicle a like vehicle to the s4 would be an bmw c63 amg bmw atsv ctsv usually those vehicles command  to rent    given the guy was underinsured i was warned to mitigate my costs and so i settled on a premium rental at 38day given it was hertzs insurance side theres like an electric fence between insurance rentals and the exotic sport or whatever they want to call them rentals apparently insurance companies dont believe you should be given a like vehicle unless like just means in size either that or they dont believe premium sports cars are ever involved in accidents    i was willing to pay lots more for an upgrade for the 3 days i needed it for the track weekend i even agreed to pay 75 extra per day of my own money in addition to the base agreement over 3 weeks before the event and still they couldnt come up with anything worthy they claimed the c250 was 75day but when i needed it it wasnt available hertz is incompetent    next time ill just make another contract with another company and let the 38day car sit idle for 3 days        toy 16 audi tts audi awd commuter 17 volkswagen volkswagen alltrack se 4motion awd wifes 16 kia kia chrysler 16t fwd,andres3
4578,March 2015,andres3 said   insurance companies dont believe you should be given a like vehicle unless like just means in size either that or they dont believe premium sports cars are ever involved in accidents  its not as simple generally like vehicle does exactly mean size and arguably some comfort feature content one could also argue for safety but thats about it the other party liability should do reasonable effort to allow you maintaining your lifestyle without much disruption so if your lifestyle includes some leisure activities requiring driving then they should in theory compensate for that but i doubt any jury or court would be too sympathetic for weekend going 100 mph somewhere moreover are you really insured for going on track in your own contract id check that if i were you  if you hit something or somebody during such an event you may be unpleasantly surprised by exclusion on your own insurance contract so if you are not even insured for that under your own contract i can see the liable party easily weasel out of their obligation at least their insurance perhaps you could sue the actual party but good luck with that too it would surely do for an interesting legal precedent  2018 430i gran coupe,dino001

4598,March 2015,is the common thought that for example the audi is an ellps but the audi is not    based on history i would keep the audi and audi in separate classes of automobiles and how is it that both the ats and cts can be ellps does that mean the cadillac is now the model called lps    one point of clarification my inclusion of cars in this class that can be optioned to numbers deep into the 60k range is not the base price it is the potential price if optioned    just like the 320 can have over 15000 of options added cranking it to just south of 48k i was suggesting the range from low to high most folks wont go for either end i would assume    and each of us brings experience to the buying of cars  and also to our expectations of features i cannot see a car without a backup camera and frankly i would think topview is better still it is a situation where due to incrementalism we get a car with say back up camera and then you miss it when it is not there    of course it will be made mandatory by the insurance institute due to the reduction in claims so youd better get one sooner rather than later who knows what once were vices will soon become necessities,markcincinnati

4615,March 2015,its true that the audi looks nothing at all like the volkswagen while as much as the acura is restyled and upgraded from the honda it has more trouble escaping its sibling more than that audi seems to signify premium and prestige even if a base audi 18 falls behind an acura on some things while costing thousands more    no doubt about it acura has an image problem i think their better products are going to slowly lure more people back into the brand but its going to be a slow process  2018 acura tchrysler tech 4ws mine 2018 honda honda ex awd wifes,benjaminh

screaming this whole thing is so darned subjective though since i still harbor the notion that pre audi the audi was ellps even though you can crank the s4 to close to 70k as because the audi was an lps    the ats is ellps as the cts is now lps as 3 series is ellps as 5 series is lps    now when the cla and the audi came along and to a certain extent the acura we dropped from regular fit to slim and then finally to petite sort of    to some here el is an indication of price  but even those who go to the trouble can find the  range for a 3 series to be from 32k to 87k    i have  historically  thought of the ellps to be mostly a smaller version of the lps family meaning size seems to in my mind still be a better trait than cost hell for the price of my s4 i could have had a premium audi but the size would clearly differentiate them    i had not and mostly still dont considered the possibility of an audi or cla or acura ever being considered for entry into the ellps class  because of my possibly wrongheaded assertion that as nice or expensive as the top o the line audi family which is called an s3 is well it is smaller than the already el entrant the audi    just as we bumped the cts to the lps class and replaced the then ellps cts with the ats we may  soon  find ourselves needing to do the same thing with the acura and audi    today however knowing only what is out there it doesnt seem to me right to have both the acura and the tchrysler called ellps cars  just like it doesnt seem right to bracket the cla and c class mercedes benz as ellps cars    it seems that base price is the hang up  not actual price  for we dont seem to argue that a 5 series is an ellps anymore than we would argue an audi or e class is an ellps  we dont because there are model designations downstream in both size and price    we have or the manufacturers have blurred the lines somewhat  and it will be another cycle before the cars are again maybe rationalized    an acura is an acura  an acura is a tarted up honda  a tchrysler has much more l  p than the acura  there is a car model not just a badge below the tchrysler  and that is the acura    currently the same breakdown is applicable to the audi and audi  but the new audi will what blur the lines further or sharpen the ford make the two more readily differentiated does anyone think the cts and ats are the same class of car  even though the msrp of the ats can be made to significantly overlap the msrp of the cts    and so on    ill settle  internally  for the tchrysler to be in the same class as the audi 3 series and c class ill accept the audi and acura and cla as similar classified cars i just find it difficult to have both the audi and audi designated as ellps cars if the 3 series is in the mix  the 3 series is marketed against the audi and c class not the audi and acura class    im more willing to overlook driven wheels  but my own money would only go for an awd vehicle knowing what i know and living in the climate i live in this rules the acura out  but keeps the tchrysler shawd firmly in the fold    this is getting difficult for me to keep straight    i love these forums and i do not want to exclude anyone from them  but for the sake of birds of a feather so to speak when i want to get into one of the forums im not going to venture into the fullsized pickup truck forum since my interests are probably not going to be well served there and vice nissan    i want to hear read your thoughts pertaining to similar vehicles  im going to gravitate toward forums where the participants are interested in and experienced with 3 series c class b8 audis audis tchrysler audi0s etc etc i dont have interest in chevrolets not that there is anything wrong with them or those who write about them or buick or 300s or 911s or stingrays same yes a fully tarted up s3 may give rise to a legitimate question about s3s vs audis or s4s but generally speaking these are meant to be separate models within the audi family    besides audi will soon be rolling out the b9 audis which will probably crank up both the l and the p and the price further differentiating the audi and audi lines mercedes benz bmw acura lexus and infiniti will almost certainly do the same thing well i think mercedes benz already has with the new c class compared to the new cla class    in any case there needs to be a place to go to discuss the cars that would appear to be competitive with each other yes i guess it is possible for someone to shop for an acura and drive out with a tchrysler shawd advance just as it is possible to look at a 328 and drive out with a bmwx  but using the auto magazine comparison test reports as guides it would be more typical for the audi to be tested against the 3 series or the c class not the audi tested against the c class and 3 series etc    my head hurts,markcincinnati
4620,March 2015,so split out compact entry level and midsize entry level still within the el family but recognizes different size mission and competitiors    acuraaudiclabmw 1 class when it arrives would be compacts heck could maybe slot in a top line volkswagen oh wait that is an audi the ats goes here too    the mid size probably a bad term are the audi 3 series 320328 volvo tchrysler infiniti mb c class etc    to further mess with your head i dont count the hipo models as entry level call them hp compactmidsize entry level that would be the s3s4 bmw etc    seems logical to me and i dont see a problem having a couple of groupings in the entry level category the all fit the basic criteria a premium model with sporting pretenses and reasonable performance to back it up and a decent level of luxury features basically a step up from your basic family sedans or small cars    and yes just like with compact to midsize family sedans there is crossover in content performance and price you can load up an audi to be fancier and more expensive than an audi and absolutely people can crossshop them same with acura to tchrysler still within the ellps family    i put the cts e class 5 series etc in the next class up i think you called them lps sans el which seems quite reasonable    hey this makes sense to me    2018 hyundai hyundai sport mine and 2013 acura acura awd wifes,stickguy

4624,March 2015,i have to assume that the reason these players and many others offer awd options for their f and r drive models is first and foremost a marketingmarket penetration decision    we can and often do debate the efficacy of awd or if a given 911 performs better or is easier or harder to drive if equipped as rwd or awd etc etc    i have to assume that bmw to pick one had managers and engineers who were against awd making its way into the bmw family today it is the rare bmw that cannot be had with awd    the reason for the proliferation of awd models is  wait for it  because they are popular they sell well and if you dont offer an lps or ellps with awd and all of your competition does you will lose market share lose revenue lose profit and you will lose your job it doesnt even matter if it can be proven that awd is better the same as or worse than whateverwd awd rules the income statement or if it doesnt rule it certainly is way too large a percentage of sales to be overlooked    bring out a new high zoot premium vehicle of the species sedan and offer it with only two wheels driven and well pretty soon the car magazines will be apologizing to the market on behalf of the company justifying their not class leading sales on the oversight  no awd  lower sales    its the auto vs stick phenom  everyone knows and agrees that sticks are superior but they linger on lots unsold and unloved go figure    sarcasm is difficult to do in these things sometimes    because you know its all about that bass  bout that bass no treble  its all bout that bass bout that bass no treble  its all bout that bass bout that bass no treble  its all bout that bass bout that bass    with apologies to meghan trainor for slightly changing the lyrics    bass   of course signed captain obvious,markcincinnati

4638,April 2015,by the way for those who poopoo awd and say it ia unnecessary of that it contributes to building a false sense of security why does porsche offer 20 different 911 models and market most with awd    my answer is because the market wants and is willing to pay for it    but the protests about awd are about as loud maybe louder than those howls about the dearth of manual transmissions that can be had in this market segment    i would however assume that porsche would not offer so many nearly all in fact of the cars they bring to market with awd if it actually eroded performance    ferdinand piech hope that is spelled correctly said he thought all cars would offer awd someday and he said that in the 80s  those who championed rwd proclaimed no way bmw lovers said there would never be an awd bmw and mercedes benz folks said there would never be an fwd mercedes benz    hmm,markcincinnati

4666,April 2015,bmw has clearly decided that the enthusiasts who built the brand 40 years ago are no longer of any significant value relative to those who appreciate numb electric steering and soft suspensions  never mind rfts and electric oil level sensors that dont always work    i havent let the door hit me on the way out and im sure the 02 of the market who feels the same way hasnt either    the real question is where do we go from here i want a dieselpowered station wagon with a manual transmission bmw makes several which would perfectly meet my desires but none are sold in north america almost no one else cares so i guess theyre doing it correctly,cdnpinhead

4682,April 2015,bmwuser said  one new home construction hasnt been over a million per year in years it may be that someone actually pays more for cars than housing over a 30 year period but imo it would be exceedingly rare i pay more in real estate taxes alone than i pay for my present 3 vehicles per year equating a home purchase with a car purchase is apples to oranges at best americans can and probably should be ridiculed for many things but the way they buy cars should be way way down the list  i did not say a million per year  but that technicality was not really the point the spirit of what i was saying was simply that cars like houses are very expensive purchases yet we seem to me and i am only speaking for me to buy these expensive durable goods with what i perceive not much discriminating thought put into the expenditure    but perhaps the system is set up that way  folks go to the auto dealership thinking they want a dark blue metallic car with an ecru interior but for the sake of  what  expediency end up with gloss black paint and a light gray interior    all i am saying about myself is i grew up in the 1960s when a brand new chrysler newport was under 4000  which for my parents was a huge purchase since it the 1963 chrysler newport was my parents first new car ever they wanted god knows why seafoam metallic a kind of medium green with a shiny tinge to it automatic transmission an am radio with a rear seat speaker a rear window defroster and power steering and power brakes my parents thought i assume since they were spending a young fortune they should get exactly what they wanted not necessarily just what was on the lot    that mode of thinking stuck with me me  not you not other mericans apparently    my way is not correct for anyone else but me but it might be for all i know  it is however not incorrect    considering it would be less expensive if we ordered cars and considering that ordering a new car is almost the only way to get exactly the car you want i simply struggle with the notion of test drive and buy today clearly cars are bought in less than logical or even financially advantageous ways makes some sense though since cars are very emotional things  or better said cars make us emotional and irrational    heres another shocking data point  my friend who owns several car dealerships claims that less than 50 of people even bother to test drive a car anymore i assume doesnt make it so this must have something to do with the age of the internet    i leave you as a product of my time  which had its formative years in the 60s and 70s apparently,markcincinnati
4683,April 2015,i think that claim of your friends is based on observation that many of his purchases are based on customer walking in and buying without testing what he doesnt see or account for are customers testing first in any location then going home sending emails and setting up transaction with the best offer which may not be the place they actually test drove  2018 430i gran coupe,dino001
4684,April 2015,dino  good point i would however say that his observation perhaps at least suggests folks dont test drive as much as they used to or as much as my wife and i do now id say my wife and i are really oddballs in that we testdrive new cars as serious hobbyists i like to think however we dont test drive cars were pretty sure wed never buy of course there was that one test drive of a new lincoln crossover what were we thinking the thing had a horrible suspension  reminded me of driving a fullsize van where we live down by the river,markcincinnati

4689,April 2015,my wife and i certainly are regularly and frequently entertained by test driving but there is actually a legitimate purpose too now remember i said we  broadly speaking  dont test drive carssuvs that we are pretty certain we would never buy for instance much as i might be entertained by driving a chevrolet i know in my heart of hearts id never buy one even with your money i just dont bother test driving them therefore    i have test driven an x6  and now i know i wouldnt buy one but at the time it did seem like it was possible also test drove an acura zdx for the money it was better than the x6 but for the money id go with an acura and pocket the 10000 likewise i just cant justify an audi audi or s7 when since i have driven both there is an audi and s6 that are as far as i am concerned identical now i do like the looks of an audi but not 10000 more than i like an audi and so on    i tested a couple of jeeps even the srt 8 version whilst we were shopping for the saudi    i cant see myself testing a chevrolet  just not interested nothing against the car per se just not for me    same with a kia soul is that spelled correctly  but i would try and have an optoma and am interested in a hyundai as a possible oldfarts alternative to an audi for when i am 73 not 63 perhaps and so forth    i dont want to waste the dealers time nor my time  but test driving is both good education and good fun or at least it can be both    ill not be testing a volkswagen bug anytime soon but i have tested the toureg and the cayenne and the audi too  a volkswagen cc sure is purty and in awd trim could be 11 on my top 10 so to speak    within reason  reason  i would think dealers need as many folks of means testing their cars as they can get their hands on my wife and i test drove an acadia a number of times  came moderately close to moving on it instead went with a 2011 infiniti infiniti    if yall want to comment with both an informed and entertained perspective on this forum i would think that plus your love and passion for cars would make you want to carve out at least one weekend every other month or so for test drive after test drive after test drive    but on the other hand kids inlaws dogs and cats broken pipes and blown ac compressors can sometimes get in the way of the serious bidness of test driving cars for a living    drive it like you live,markcincinnati

4695,May 2015,stickguy said  dino isnt the 4 gc by definition a rarity so easily within the 5 margin you are likely pretty unique in terms of what you want so certainly should order but that doesnt mean the majority of buyers arent getting what they want by settling    i guess though this is a board about higher end more expensive cars so out of the mainstream    it also would suck if your car died and you had to wait 12 weeks for a replacement  4cg is selling much better then what bmw was expecting its a rarity because bmw cant produce then fast enough,flightnurse

4796,June 2015,one of the things about the audi0 that i noticed  having come from an fx with the same motor  is a certain er coarseness the pros call it thrashing that the other japanese and germans lack now having said that the 37l motor in the audi0 seems to have been given a extra shot of sound deadening but at fullcry the engine which is still good just shows its more unrefined side    the lexus especially compared with the acura was a bit cdodgeped inside but after having had a tl everything seems a bit tighter and i would quickly forget the relative girth of the acura yet the lexus had a nicer interior than the bmw 3  of that i am certain    i am finding out that i am not a fan of the north and south display screens eg in the audi0 and acura it makes the interior look a bit chopped up    to each hisher own on that count though i hate the pop up nav screen that is all the rage these days  looks so much like something from the aftermarket pioneer indash head units come to mind,markcincinnati

4828,August 2015,i cant drive 55    you must know by my id here that i live in cincinnati the smsa of this city is about 15m the last time i looked the city itself has a population of under 400k technically then most of us dont live in the city i earn my living however in the corp limit as does my wife    i drive to work  or at least i used to  on two interstates i275 and i71 i have tried driving on these interstates at the early and late normal times and find myself often putt putting along at whatever speed the car can manage at idle in winter it is even worse    i have now taken to driving on secondary roads and residential streets  just to be able to get to 35mph  50mph    i am currently driving an audi s4  a car that in the blink of an eye can almost reach triple digit speeds and the thing feels like it is on rails making it a great hiway chrysler capable of an easypeasy drive from cincinnati to columbus at speeds north of 80mph    i have not driven an rs7 i have driven a 2015 s6 however and even that was somewhat frustrating since it is capable of feats of fancy that are virtually impossible on the roads i drive to go about my business    i used to think if i had trump money i would certainly go for a supercar or at least an entrylevel super car not any more    i really enjoy my s4  the few times ive been able to really push it i have been impressed with its performance envelope i suspect i would find going back to a 20t equipped audi a let down but i also suspect i would find moving forward with an rs4 if a sedan version were to be made available in the us would be a let down too  or at least immensely frustrating    an unlimited bank account would allow me to acquire for instance an rs7 or whatever else might pass these days as a super sedan an bmw too would qualify but what advantage would i have  i rarely can use the full accelerative force my pedestrian s4 provides were i to attempt to punch it i would more often than not find myself overtaking and potentially dodgeming rig for dodgeming speed the pokey car in front of me    cutting yet another second off of my ability to accelerate would be  in theory  fun and potentially a safety feature if you say it real fast and squint 062mph in 37 seconds could be a safety feature couldnt it but uh really i think it is safe to say it is so highly unlikely i could ever use that much quickness it would just be very very frustrating heck it is already frustrating with the urge my lowly s4 musters    so i have reached a point where i lust for the kind of performance that is available and currently unaffordable  but i also balance that lust with the reality that it is not virtually impossible to use such power it is literally impossible to do so    so i ask myself why bother  traffic is not getting any better speeds are not getting any higher abilities to actually use such accelerative force are waning as each day passes    im just about ready to use public transportation  oh wait we dont have much of that here in river city so i have to putt putt along in my entry level super sedan well sort of wondering what it would be like to as my buddy says punch it    dilyl  55mph actually would be an improvement,markcincinnati

4869,August 2015,at this point as i said most of us are unable to notice the subtleties between most awd systems regardless of msrp i do not count myself among those who are able to discern the difference between many awd systems  unless they are of the fwd power biased flavor my tl shawd was fwd biased and it did seem to have gobs of torque steer which my audis do not exhibit    today subarus no matter what their content or technology are not in the premium class for all i know they do have audi awd chops and are 20k or 40k less even the cd comparo ended with the conclusion that the authors would take a 2010 s4 over a new subaru i read their words i do not have any experience that would allow me to make an informed and possibly biased or unbiased comment on the matter    i would initially expect a 60k car to be in some ways superior to a 30 or 40k car content styling performance the whole packagewise this would not be an indictment against the lesser cost vehicle    for the moeny were i to be given a subaru budget i would not opt for the 5year old audi  i would indeed go with something new very possibly the subaru    my experiene would lead me to advise someone who wanted s4like performance for less money to look seriously at an acura tchrysler shawd advance if the premium car experience was unimportant to this someone i would certainly suggest they shop subaru especially if one of their criteria was having awd    i have very recently read some reviews of the nissan nissan platinum version  while not a member of the premium class as defined by someone somewhere this new nissan certainly seems to ring many of the bells that one would normally associate with ellps  although infiniti folks would certainly beg to differ    most of what i seem to come across in my google searches are essays and sites that praise audis torsen based audi system as one of the best or sometimes even the best awd systems currently on the market    that subarus system may be right up there is something i shall surely remember when i come across such commentary or test reports mean time since were not speakingdiscussing here of either lambos or subbies systems i suggest we discuss an even larger issue for some folks awd vs 2wd  my position is that awd is what the market is looking for and willing to spend money on i would postulate that one of the hallmarks required for sustainable success in the market is  are four driven wheels,markcincinnati

4876,August 2015,as an s4 owner i would like to chime in with the subi comments imo for the money not a better awd system to buy is a subi with the boxer engine someone mentioned cost to own made a valid point the cars are in high demand on the used car market and some used car dealers are having issues getting cars from auctions because even high mileage leased cars are going back on manufactures lots because resale is so strong and they are not producing new ones fast enuf  dont believe me httpswwwcarscomarticlesjunesfastestandslowestsellingcars1420680685995    has anyone watched a full season of baseball 162 games  same amount of time it takes a caddy dealer to sell one ats car wow  no wonder people getting deals on those and other caddy sedans wonder after one year and a few miles prob could get a jacked out ats in the 20s and a cts v sport in high 30s  could that be possible    my take subi a great car for money for sure but its not an audi  open the door of a subaru vs an audi  then close them huge difference money always matters but not same class,sweendogy
4877,August 2015,2014 ats v6 premiums grab around 32k at auction so figure somewhere in the mid 36k range retail the 4cyl luxury models however are in the mid 20s so high 20s is possible if you dont want a jacked out version and can deal with the base nonturbo engine    v sport premiums are in the mid 40s still which means high 40s retail knock off about 5k for a nonpremium model  17 ford crew 27 67 coronet rt 14 towncountry limited 09 lsubaru hse 44car history and counting,qbrozen

4882,August 2015,tweener    i dont know about you but i do wish there was something in between an audi and and audi or a 3 series and a 5 series no no an audi or 4 series wont do the reason i want something that is really inbetween is i just want something a little bit bigger and this is a contradiction  i know  ive flip flopped on this more than twice    i was loaned an audi 30t with a sport package i liked it  but even with the sport package it didnt seem to be quite as nimble as i had misremembered it would be then today 4 of us from my office went to lunch together  well the two folks in the back seat of the s4 were this close to having enough knee room  another inch back seat space would have been fine  two inches ample    i keep holding out hope that the new audis4 coming out next year will grow slightly in all directions  but meantime the gap between the audi and audi is large enough i think for there to be something that would fit in between maybe an audi gulp sedan or a junior audi    btw drove an s6 again  love the power love everything about it except it is too big well it would be most of the time and it gives off so very few s cues from behind the wheel it is somewhat disappointing it performs great  has gobs of go and stopping power and it does have an s suspension from a capability perspective  but the car is a cocoon usually a good thing but when you pay that much it would be nice if it had a bit of grrr to be found    im still lookin for the tweener    plain and simple,markcincinnati
4883,August 2015,qbrozen i would agree the bmw and v sport are close one is a bmw with a beefie 8 vs a caddy 6and one with more powerful engine   bigger thing is one is german lux vs american who is trying to find a younger audience for your grandpas caddy while they are close the 535 is a better comp ,sweendogy
4884,August 2015,bmw compares to ctsv  550 compares to the v sport  535 compares to the nonturbo cts 36  528 compares to the cts 20t    the 550 has a little more peak power but it is 300 lbs heavier which is why the vsport outperforms it  17 ford crew 27 67 coronet rt 14 towncountry limited 09 lsubaru hse 44car history and counting,qbrozen
4885,August 2015,markcincinnati  i dont disagree that a little more rear legroom would be nice than whats currently offered in the 34 series and the audi5 but not so sure how much room there is to slot another model between those and the 5series and audi    the 3series gt sort of offers what you speak of with loads of rear seat legroom on that longer 3series platform whether you like the looks of the vehicle is a different matter    im sure the new audi next year will offer some sort of increase in size  maybe that will be a sweetspot for you i am finding myself quite fond of the size of the current s4  from a driving perspective i liken it to the 335 e90 i had a little while ago and compared to that the audi adds just enough extra room to make it feel a little less compact    2018 audi audi  2016 volvo polestar  2017 volkswagen r  2017 miata rf,breld

4908,September 2015,so the trip from slovenia to erbusco italy was a straight shot on the autostrata as we wanted to get to the resort we were staying at it exceeded our expectation it is nestled in the foothills of wine country of northern italy the resort is surrounded by grape vineyards a perfect place to relax once we arrived we just drove around the area to take in the sights    yesterday we went to lake como now lake como is shaped like an upside down y for me its one of the most beautiful areas of italy when we left the resort it was gloomy and overcast on the trip up we got hit with a very heavy downpour which cleaned the windshield of all bugs we stopped in varenna for lunch then took the ferry to bellagio yes the hotel in vegas is named after the city then we drove home but the rain had stopped but was still gloomy didnt matter the area is still beautiful    hotel in varenna just on the water        waiting for the ferry to arrive the bentlys owner saw our plates and asked where we were from when i told him he stated he was jealous of what we north americans can do with the ed        out on the lake              lastly when we got back to the resort there was a infiniti audi0 that had a 22l turbodiesel    oh yeah on the start of this adventure i got a ticket for going the wrong going down a road the damn gps told me to go but i didnt see the sign saying one way 2750 euro fine    we are off to monaco nice and marseille staying in marseille    ciao,flightnurse

4911,September 2015,so we drove from erbusco to marseilles france yesterday we decided to just do the superslab and get there fast well 8 hour fast    so my impressions of italian drivers they arent as reckless as you hear about they follow most of the german or austrian driving rules 1 they only use the right lane to pass 2 they use their left turn signal if they want you to move over and 3 yes some are crazy    so we are motoring down the audi autostrata and come up to slower traffic so we slow down then barreling down on us is a volkswagen volkswagen wagon they are big in italy and yes its a tdi the volkswagen driving is flashing his lights turn signal on looks pissed that i didnt move over once we clear traffic and people move over this whole time volkswagen driver is inchs from my bumper i nail the gas we have 2200km on the car and wham talk off volkswagen growing smaller and smaller in the mirror top out at 135mph we reach slower traffic volkswagen own barreling down doing the same thing flashing lights turn signal giving me the italian salute not too sure if it was a good one or bad one again once traffic opens up and people move up i take off and the volkswagen gets smaller and smaller in the mirror again top out at 135 reach slower traffic again volkswagen driver flashing lights and turn signal this time once we clear traffic i get in front of slower traffic and pulled over the right land this audi has 3 lanes in each direction and the volkswagen pulled up its quite funny he can tell he has it floored but not moving so fast i nail it get in front and pull away had to slow down speed limit lowered to 110 kph volkswagen owner catchs up and passes me he finally got what he wanted its interesting that it doesnt matter what country they are from they all barrel down on you at warp drive then get stuck on your bumper like that is going to make the car in front go faster    france    what to say about france if you think the germans have an aire of attitude you need to come from france the attitude is we can do that because we are french merging traffic they will pull in front of you if there is day light between you and the car in front they dont care about their cars well most french dont    we stopped in monaco did the tourist thing stopped in front f the casino and got a photo of the car talk about crowded the cars wow the cars i got one photo of a lambo lots of make there too the streets are narrow really narrow lots of construction going on and our gps wasnt updated on this so it took a little longer to get to the casino but we got there    marseilles    what to say about marseilles i didnt know much about the city except it was a port city its a very old city and it shows when you come in from the toll road you come in through the slums the gps worked great some of the streets we went down were really narrowdirty and stinky insane is a word that rick used a lot    my thoughts of marseilles lots of immigrants usually from north africa lots of different cultures christians muslims and so on have seen some women in burkas walking about here and all over europe the native people of marseilles arent happy with most of the immigrants its a very diverse city the food says it all more on that later    so here are the photos from our trip to france    in italy they have rest stops but nothing like what have in the us the rest stop has gas food and places to eat the food outside and they are superclean the next couple of photos is one place we stopped to get gas and something to munch on                            so we stopped at a french version of the roadside gasconvenience store what a big difference the placed looked like it was about to be shutdown hardly no drinks in the coolers and the bathrooms look disgusting this was the real reason why we stopped see for yourself a far cry from what the ones in italy looked like                so cars in europe we have seen some american cars over here here is a photo of one that we had a good laugh at          monaco is supper clean very clean in fact monaco is not a country it is part of france but it is a principality their license plates say principality of monaco on them                  so i know you are all waiting for that lambo photo so here it is        traffic lights are interesting here if you do not stop behind the crosswalks you will not see the traffic lights but the french being the french have a fix          once again the gps she works well she really does but at times i have to wonder when we left monaco we put into the gps the hotel address and said the faster route even toll roads well for about 60 km we were on two lane country roads then finally back on the toll roads she tries        so ill end this installment with a photo taken from our balcony over looking the harbor and looking at the monument that is roughly 500 yrs old its a night photo,flightnurse

4918,September 2015,you commented about german er personalities then followed up with your observations about french personalities granted my european travels have been entirely recreational but i would say that only in 2 countries have i ever noted an attitude that was less than gracious france several times and switzerland once in lucerne come to think of it the person in lucerne had a heavy french hyundai    the german people have always been friendly polite courteous and sometimes playful even ive been to oktoberfest about 6 times and when going into a beer tent you join a large group of people at a picnic table and within a few minutes it seems the folks are wanting to know about the us us sports and are trying to teach us americans some of the germanonly songs that come up every 15 minutes or so between good ol rock and roll a gentleman and his father were in munich for oktoberfest and when they found out my wife was a lawyer the older man bought my wife an order of peeled radishes covered in salt from one barrister to another we had a great time the folks on the subways in munich too are always willing to help you figure out which stop will get you closest to your destination    in france on the other hand we went to a bistro like you see in the movies in paris and the waiter gave up his picture for the dictionary next to the word surly apparently since tipping is not as serious as it is in the us this waiter was actually pissed when we thanked him in english when he brought us our wine beer and cheese saying in heavily hyundaied french why cant you people even try to speak french ok well perhaps i could say merci but other than asking hows the weather and saying i like chocolate ice cream i didnt think i wanted to embarrass myself or run the risk of butchering my communications especially since the menu we were given was multilingual how wude    the staff at our 5star hotel in paris was totally gracious and friendly but my impression from several interactions with the locals was that they dont like us much  or maybe they just dont like me i went ahead and gave an american tip anyway who knows if anything changed the italians were huggers and bothcheek kissers didnt have that happen in germany but they were friendlier than the french    fn i have no clue as to your age  i am 63  i started going to europe when i was about 20 years younger and richer but it can be done for not too much money if you realize that most of the time you spend in a hotel it is dark meaning 3star hotels with air conditioning work just fine once i got over the sense that we needed 5 star hotels because well you never know we found we could see europe for not much money saving our coin for fine dining instead also we dont use cabs anymore we figure out how to use the trains and subways  and for the long trips we splurge on first class train travel if the distance is over 5 hours also became a fan of night trains with full size beds saves on hotel bills too my point is unless youre much much older i urge you to make this trip one of many many more you should take benelux was a fun couple of trips  amsterdam brussles and luxembourg city do it again do it again    anyway youve taken me at least on a great vicarious trip with you two my only regret is that you didnt get an audi but theres always next time    keep em coming    ciao baby,markcincinnati

4924,September 2015,ive been reading and watching the tv biz channels as they pontificate on the meaning of all of this stuff the current news is that this is a rerun cadillac did it got fined ford did it etc apparently 11m volkswagens numbers vehicles had this software installed well honda got caught a few years back  same thing    the list of whos done it seems to be much bigger than the current scandal    this doesnt forgive any company  and it is more serious than hyundai fudging the mgps of their cars or acura claiming their cars had more hp than could be tested and so on  but the thing is i have read in car magazines interviews over the years from top car company executives who have claimed the mpg and emissions requirements go to the practical limit of technology then go beyond what is known to be capable for any realistic sum of money    nothing said here is meant to forgive the lie    however isnt it possible  in the current climate  to find some objective engineers andor scientists who could say here is what we are able to do today at this price here is what were able to do today at that price and so forth i understand if a martin winterkorn goes before the government and says this is what is possible at a cost of xxx per car and what you want us to do would cost xxxx per car the government doubts the veracity of the remarks    so the government wants a car to emit this much pollution and go this far on a gallon of fuel or whatever is used to power the vehicle apparently it cant be done at a market acceptable price today then you factor in that cafe often gives a pass to trucks so the mfgr goes ahead and creates a 2cylinder car with a cardboard back seat no sound insulation and made with the lightest weight materials  that are inexpensive  known to the designers    i guess it is possible to increase the epa ratings in all of the good ways by making cars out of carbon fiber and unobtanium and powering them with a fuel cell and a solar sail  but said cars will cost 300 of the traditionally built autos so youre 25000 car will satisfy the epa etc but it will cost 75000    this if at least in spirit is correct is unworkable and for most folks unaffordable    again this does not forgive lying but i can only assume that the corporate thought process since it keeps happening over and over arrives at the conclusion that the cost of getting caught is less than the cost of attempting compliance since the cost of compliance is apparently like unobtainium simply too high to adopt    too big to fail who knows if volkswagen is too big to fail  but if the death of the volkswagen enterprise is the eventual cost of this transgression and disregard for law well whos next    i would hope the regulated rather than lie make a convincing compelling case in response to unreasonable andor unaffordable legislative requirements    here is what i want a car that accelerates to 60 in 3 seconds gets over 75mpg tops out at 155mph stops from 70mph in 100 feet holds 5 people and their luggage and costs 25000 i have to assume this is like the old saw you can have this product or service fast of highquality or inexpensive  pick two    seems to me the regulatory agencies the world over expect it to be pick three    were not there apparently yet,markcincinnati
4925,September 2015,hondaing to an article i read somewhere but cant find right now someone with mazdarity with emissions systems said it would have probably cost volkswagen only 200300 more per car to make them actually pass the test almost certainly they would have also gotten a couple of notches lower on the mpg and hp scales but it could have been done    the govt is not asking for the impossible at this point about 8 years from now however things get challenging with cafe mpg standards but with 8 more years of r  d on that front who knows what improvements well see    many midsize cars sold for 2016 already meet the cafe mpg requirements for c 2021  2018 acura tchrysler tech 4ws mine 2018 honda honda ex awd wifes,benjaminh
4926,September 2015,markcincinnati    keep in mind that the emission fuel economy and safety standards are not decided in a vacuum manufacturers and their lobbyists work closely with the epa and nhtsa to come up with achievable targets the government knows they cant pick arbitrary standards that would make products so expensive that the average consumer couldnt buy them its all negotiated    as for volkswagen and the inability to meet the target remember they are able to meet the target when the vehicle is in test mode im guessing that performance fuel economy or cost targets could not be met without the test mode hence the deception,robr2
4927,September 2015,well obviously they could make the cars pass the test for no extra money because they did pass the tests    the problem isnt that they didnt pass it is they essentially did a cheater tune job themselves as opposed to owners that chip a car to get the same end result    i assume the fix is just a flash update to make the test cheater tune the standard and only option    i admit not having had time to read the articles about this i have seen the up to 40x stuff which i assume is worst case not close to average but is there decent reports on what the hp and mpg hit to running the test tune all the time would be  2018 hyundai hyundai sport mine and 2013 acura acura awd wifes,stickguy

4931,September 2015,i am sitting here watching a tv show on the subject of the cost to make the cars in question compliant with their claims the expert i have no idea who he is but he does not appear to be currently at least from a car mfgr claims something like the cost per car to make them compliant is over 35000 per car i dont even know of any volkswagens that new retailed for that much    anyone who reads andor watches conventional media knows that so many of these companies that try to get away with things dont therefore someone who measures risk must have come to the conclusion that the risk cost of the lie is lower than the risk cost of compliance why else would someone make such a decision especially if the cost per car would be 200 or 300 as suggested here elsewhere    another news story claims that as a practical matter which i assume is code for the cost of meeting the standards would make the cars in question unsellable there is no current way to meet these requirements    sure discoveries are made every day and i think it is reasonable to conclude that it is possible to get to zero emissions  but diesel engines must make things more difficult andor prohibitively expensive    if i thought i could comply and simply pass the cost along to a willing market why would i risk even the possibility of being caught fudging the numbers    something doesnt add up  i mean why would cadillac have done the same thing a few years ago why would the other companies fudge hp or mpg ratings or not fix ignition switches and in the case of ignition switches there was an inexpensive fix    i understand there are epa haters and of course there are car company haters but time and again when it is possible for a secret or cover up to be discovered it is  is for example martin winterkorn a boob someone who doesnt read or watch tv where it is possible to see a peanut company exec go to jail for 28 years for trying to cover up tainted peanut butter or gm being called out for faulty ignition switches or cadillac being fined for cooking epa compliance records    said it before the only way to keep a secret between 3 people is if 2 of them are dead how many people at volkswagen knew did it not ever occur to anyone that a curious guy from the university of west virginia or where ever would test one of these cars and uncover the deceit    as somewhat of a student of adam smith im not really sure if this is the invisible hand at work  it seems more like the work of a statistician who advised illadvised id say management that the cost of compliance is far more dear than the cost of getting caught cheating    i just missed what the president of nissan was just saying in an interview but it seems to be something like we all do it because the costs of compliance are too dear    wonder how this will all play out at this point im going with too big to fail    this too shall pass,markcincinnati

4937,September 2015,what kind of additional costs are we talking about for adblue annually at the 20l engine size    this too makes no sense to me  diesel cars cost more than gas engined cars so is it possible that buying a diesel volkswagen for a not easy to ignore price premium vs a less expensive gas engined version hinged on the lack of the need to use adblue    i guess it is possible that someone on a budget would spring for a diesel but again it doesnt seem as probable to me that someone would do that    my issues with diesel until quite recently have been the scarcity of gas stations that also offer diesel now i would see only positives to getting one of audis new high performance diesels which all require adblue    my wifes boss has an adblue equipped diesel vehicle  loves it especially the tank range    me i have an s4 with a sippycup gas tank that only allows practically speaking something over 350 miles between fillups my wifes saudi on the other hand approaches 500 miles between fill ups,markcincinnati

4994,November 2015,our experience with acura audi bmw and infiniti over the past decade is that the oil change includes an inspection report and other fluids top off also included is a wash and vacuum tire pressure too is checked and set and sometimes tire rotation is part of the deal    we drop the car off at 6pm pick up the loaner and come back the next day at 6pm and pick up the car conversely if you dont want that level of involvement you can opt for the dealer to come to you pick up the car leave a loaner and return later with your car all services accomplished    90 second oil changes seem like something you might want on your car once the od shows in excess of 50000 miles  maybe my opinion is that i want to visit the dealer for the above noted services even after the warranty has expired    of course this time my grand plan  is to cpo my own car at the dealership which will extend the factory warranty to 100000 miles this experiment also includes buying two service packs which will take the factory mntce progdodge to 85000 miles    my wifes 2014 saudi just hit 49900 miles  and were going to run naked on this one  thinking well trade it in sometime shortly after it crosses 90000 miles since there seems to be a huge resale drop in value at about 100k miles    this is all new territory for us since her saudi is the first car weve owned since 1977    ill let you know how this works out in a couple of years,markcincinnati

5047,March 2016,circlew said  here is a good lease on a bmw        that isnt a very good deal im sure you would walk into the dealership and get it for less also with that payment the mf isnt at the base rate the gts arent selling that well,flightnurse
5048,March 2016,flightnurse  good point they mention the 7 msds but not the starting mf from which they are deducted    00135 is the base mf this month but the dealer can mark it up to 00175  moderator    2016 volkswagen volkswagen 14t se  2015 subaru subaru 36r  2014 mini countryman s all4    need help navigating michaelledmundscom  or send a private message by hyundaiing on my name    share your vehicle reviews,Michaell

5052,April 2016,mrshiftright said  youre also losing one months lease payment in the investment interest you would lose on giving them 3850 of your money for 3 years  one thing people dont get with msds is over the life of the lease you are saving on average about 1900 plus you get the msds back when you turn the car,flightnurse
5053,April 2016,flightnurse said  show previous quotes  one thing people dont get with msds is over the life of the lease you are saving on average about 1900 plus you get the msds back when you turn the car  yeah but the dealer can jack up the mf and if they do that to the max as michael points out thats one whole 1 more interest and those 7 payments are held hostage against any damage read the fine print not a great position for negotiation at turnin    but your point is welltaken nonetheless and should be considered along with everything else    moderator need help with anything hyundai on my name  share your vehicle reviews here,Mr_Shiftright
5054,April 2016,that was something i wondered about with the msds on my lease there is no security deposit so if they want to ding me for damage they have to ask for it and i can argue but if they have 3500 on account they can keep whatever they want and i would have to fight them to get it back  2018 hyundai hyundai sport mine and 2013 acura acura awd wifes,stickguy

5058,April 2016,depends on whats in the contractit should state or not whether the msd can be used against damages at turnin  moderator need help with anything hyundai on my name  share your vehicle reviews here,Mr_Shiftright

5060,April 2016,true enough but there are shades of gray as to what represents significant damage ive also heard of cases where one inspection seeeds rather perfunctory and another very detailed go figure  moderator need help with anything hyundai on my name  share your vehicle reviews here,Mr_Shiftright

5063,April 2016,i had a rented audi sedan this past week i have to say i was a bit underwhelmed while i realize it was probably a base model the interior while nice had quite a bit of hard door plastics etc imho the dash looks kind of cheap with the worst part being the round air vents the driving feel was ok but not great the engine i assume it was a turbo 4 was somewhat harsh at idle but had good power upon acceleration the leather seats were decent and the car looks attractive    compared to my 1998 audi that was about the same size the older audi was way nicer thank the audi imho,tlong
